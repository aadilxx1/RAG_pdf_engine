With eight billion people on \nthe planet, that adds up to a lot of waste.\nIn some regions of the world, people buy more than they \nneed and generate a lot of waste in the process, while in \nother regions people buy less and generate less waste.\nThe purple circles in Figure 1 show the large differences \nin waste generated per capita (per person). The average \nperson in North America generates more than two \nkilograms (kg) of waste every day, while in Central and \nSouth Asia, the average person generates just 0.4 kg (400 \ngrams) of waste per day.

As part of a UNEP project funded by the United Nations \nDevelopment Account, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) developed \nnational assessments in 2022 of the ‘costs of inaction’ of tackling air pollution in three Southeast \nAsian countries – Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. The assessments were developed through \ncooperation with The Ministry of Environment in Cambodia, The Ministry of Health in Indonesia, and \nThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in Thailand. Using 12 of the 15 solutions identified \nin this report, each assessment compared a baseline scenario–in which no new policies are introduced \n- with alternative future mitigation scenarios in which a bundle of new measures are implemented. \nThe analysis employed the Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS)", "metadata": {"page": 54}}

The results give an approximate quantification of the economic costs related to morbidity and \nmortality that would be incurred if further mitigation actions are not taken.\nSome of the key findings this work suggest that the costs of delays, considering health impacts from \nair pollution exposure, can be significant. For instance, in the case Cambodia an initial assessment \nsuggests that delays can result in costs that are comparable to over 2% of GDP . Meanwhile, for \nIndonesia a similar calculation reveals postponing implementation of the 12 key solutions could result \nin losses equivalent to nearly 2% of GDP . Finally, results from Thailand tell a similar story: policymakers \nare confronted with health-related costs that are equivalent to nearly 1% of GDP in the face of delays. \nThe main message that comes from this work is that there are not only sizable costs from waiting, but \nappreciable benefits from stronger and quicker implementation.\nThe above message is also consistent with studies focused on benefit and cost ratios for specific \nsectoral interventions.

The first need involves integrated planning.  \nThis need was broken into several smaller \nsteps. The first step would be relevant \ngovernment staff and academics understand \nbackground information.

A final need involves mobilizing funding . In \nterms of attracting funding, one of the possible \nchannels is leveraging resources from climate \nchange funds like the Green Climate Fund. \nAnother possibility is working with development \nbanks, like the ADB, to tap funds that can \nsupport the implementation of air pollution \nand health benefits of investment projects.

This \nannex provides a review of those 10 changes.\nFirst, the current calculations are based on the \ndevelopment of a new sub-model for the waste \nmanagement sector as well as elements of \ntransport model (high emitting vehicles). For waste \nmanagement, since 2017 the information that is \nnecessary to estimate emissions of methane and \nHFCs has been updated based on the recently \npublished papers (Purohit et al. 2018; Höglund-\nIsaksson et al. 2020; Gómez-Sanabria et al. 2021)\nbreaking reductions down to regional and sector \nlevels using the most recent version of IIASA’s \nGreenhouse gas and Air pollution Interactions and \nSynergies (GAINS). The update relies on the datasets \nreported in those papers. For example, instead of \nestimating total municipal waste generation and \nthen assuming share of waste that is burned, the \nnew model distinguishes different types of waste \n(e.g., food, textile, plastic, metal, glass, paper, \nwood) and various management options including \nuncontrolled burning of trash, more", "metadata": {"page": 171}}

The macroeconomic data, mostly \npopulation, urbanization, and GDP were used to \ndevelop regionally specific projection of waste \ngeneration while local information was used about \nwaste management and emission factors, provided \nthey were available (otherwise IPCC defaults were \nused). For details see (Gómez-Sanabria et al. 2018; \nHöglund-Isaksson et al. 2020; Gómez-Sanabria et \nal. 2021). The use of this data allows for a more \naccurate accounting of emissions from the waste \nsector, including the burning of residential waste.\nSecond, the data for high-emitting vehicles  have \nbeen improved.

These estimates \nhave been revisited introducing emissions from soil, \ni.e., application of mineral and organic manures will \nresult in emissions of NO from soil.\nFourth, there have been updates to the 2015 \nsocioeconomic and energy data as well as updated \nto projections of future economic activities (e.g., \nenergy use, industrial production, agricultural \nactivities) up to 2030 , inter alia , based on the \nregional trends of the World Energy Outlook 2018 \nof the International Energy Agency (IEA 2018). \nThe choice to use the WEO 2018 dataset has \nbeen motivated by the fact that it has been also \nused in development of global scenarios in GAINS \n(ECLIPSE_V6b) that served as input for large scale \nmodelling studies, for example, for Asia (Kanaya et \nal. 2020), Arctic (Im et al. 2021), Europe (Gauss et \nal. 2021), and at", "metadata": {"page": 173}}

IIASA \nhas been independently evaluating the reported fuel \nuse comparing it with the available surveys in several \ncountries (e.g. Hoang 2011) and using a simple \nmodel calculating energy demand for cooking, \nconsidering information about access to electricity, \ngas, coal, wood or agriculture residues. In case \nthe IIASA calculation resulted in ±20% difference \nwith IEA, IIASA retained original IEA numbers but \nwhere the difference was much larger data was re-\nestimated and updated with newly developed GAINS \nnumbers. The most prominent example is data for \nIndonesia where according to IIASA estimates, IEA \nstatistics significantly overestimate use of solid \nfuels", "metadata": {"page": 175}}

This includes passenger cars, light duty \ntrucks, motorcycles, heavy duty trucks, and busses. \nThis is relevant since the emission factors and status \nof legislation varies for these categories impacting \nnot only quality of estimating current emissions \nbut also potential for further mitigation. Further \nupdates have involved the systematic consideration \nof high emitting vehicles, which are introduced in \nthe model calculation assuming region and vehicle \ntype specific shares of vehicles that emit several-\nfold of the valid emission standards due to e.g., \nmalfunction or purposeful manipulation of engine or \nemission control system – the assessment is based \n", "metadata": {"page": 176}}

Introduction of ambitious air quality policy in \nparts of Asia resulted in application (and often own \nproduction) of very efficient cleaning technologies \nwhich represent often state of the art also from the \nglobal perspective. Consequently, in the assessment \nof the mitigation potential we have applied higher \nreduction efficiencies that were shown to be \nachievable in Asia, especially to reduce emissions \nof primary PM 2.5 (e.g., highly efficient multistage \nelectrostatic precipitators or fabric filters) and \nSO2 (high efficiency flue gas desulphurization). \nFor residential sector, specifically cooking on \nsolid fuels, GAINS model includes now an explicit \nrepresentation of LPG stoves and for agriculture \nimpact", "metadata": {"page": 177}}

The 2025 \nedition of this report addresses four issues that need \ngreater attention from policymakers.\nThe first issue is the threat posed by reactivated microbes \nin a warming cryosphere. Frozen in ice sheets, glaciers and \npermafrost are bacteria, fungi and viruses. While most are \ndead, some are dormant and some are active. As global \ntemperatures hit record highs, these microorganisms will \nbecome more active in many ecosystems. Even if melt can \nbe slowed down by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, \nwe must assess and prepare for possible threats from \npotential pathogens. Also crucial is documenting and \npreserving cryospheric microorganisms, which can \nshed light on the history of climate and evolution, help \nin finding therapies for diseases and develop innovative \nbiotechnologies.\nThe second issue is the growing need to remove barriers, \nsuch as dams, to rehabilitate river ecosystems – a process \nincreasingly initiated by local communities, Indigenous \nPeoples, women and youth. Rivers and streams can \nrecover remarkably once barriers are gone, but other \nstressors such as land-use, pollution and climate change \nneed to be addressed in parallel. Understanding the \nrestoration outcomes of barrier removal is necessary not \nonly to guide future removals but also to inform decisions \nabout existing and future barriers.\n", "metadata": {"page": 10}}

Understanding the \nrestoration outcomes of barrier removal is necessary not \nonly to guide future removals but also to inform decisions \nabout existing and future barriers.\nThe third issue is the risk to ageing populations from \nenvironmental degradation. It is estimated that the global \nshare of people over 65 years old will rise from 10 per cent \nin 2024 to 16 per cent by 2050. Most of these people will \nlive in cities – where they will be exposed to extreme heat \nand air pollution, and experience more frequent disasters. \nOlder people are already more at risk. Effective adaptation \nstrategies will need to evolve to protect these older \npopulations.\nThe final issue is the danger posed by legacy pollutants \nreleased as extreme rainfall and floods wash away \nsediments and debris. The Pakistan floods of 2010, \nflooding in the Niger Delta in 2012 and Hurricane Harvey \noff the coast of Texas in 2017 are all examples when \nfloodwaters stirred up sediments, releasing heavy metals \nand persistent organic pollutants.

In the European Union, \nflood retention practices align with the Water Framework Directive’s goal of \nprotecting and restoring water bodies for sound ecological and chemical \nstatus.167 Many European river basins fail to achieve a good ecological status \nbecause of engineering modifications to rivers like dikes, dams, weirs, and \nembankments.168 However, the impact of such restoration measures on the \nDirective’s second goal – to achieve a good chemical status – concerning \nthe retention and remobilization of contaminated sediment and suspended \nparticulate matter – remains largely unknown.24 \nWhen relocating dikes for flood-management objectives in densely populated \nareas, difficulties can arise due to conflicts of interest that involve land use for \nsettlements, transportation infrastructure, agriculture, and forestry.

Food systems must\n \nbe transformed to become more \nsustainable, efficient and resilient, \nfor better production, better nutrition, \na better environment and a better \nlife (United Nations 2023). These \nefforts are being undertaken through \nthe formulation of national food \nsystems transformation pathways. \nFor India, it is vital to increase the \nsustainability of food systems to \ndeliver affordable, healthy food and \nadvancing equitable livelihoods [1] to \na population estimated to reach 1.66 \nbillion by 2050 (United Nations 2022). \nIndia’s G20 Presidency noted that \n“sustainable, diversified and resilient \nagriculture and food systems offer \nsignificant opportunities to address \nclimate change, land degradation, \nover-exploitation of water resources, \nbiodiversity and forest loss while ", "metadata": {"page": 5}}

However, women are deprived of land rights and seldom \nparticipate in marketing of crops where production is translated into income. As per the Agriculture \nCensus 2015-16, 11.72 per cent of the total agricultural operation area was operated by women \noperational holders (India, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare 2021). This highlights the \nneed of addressing the gender gap to promote economic development. \n12. Methodology introduced by Ravisankar et al.

WAY FORWARD\nAs per the NITI Aayog, India finds itself today at a position where considerations can be made \non shifting two per cent of its cropped area each year to sustainable farming practices without \ncreating any shortfall in meeting domestic demand for food, potentially resulting in 20 per cent \nof the cultivated land transitioning to sustainable farming practices by 2030, up from the current \ncoverage (Chand and Singh 2023). Given that India is at an important juncture of its agriculture \ndevelopment, where addressing critical overarching questions on the costs and benefits of a \ntransition requires strong scientific evidence to guide decisions, TEEBAgriFood provides a robust \nframework to precisely address these concerns. As demonstrated in the three pilot project \nStates, the application of the TEEBAgriFood framework has provided important insights into \nbenefits and trade-offs of scaling organic farming and agroforestry not only across natural, \nproduced, human and social capitals but also with regards to changing climate scenarios. \nMoreover, towards strengthening the linkages between economy and environment, the Ministry \nof Statistics and Program Implementation (MoSPI) has prepared a Strategy for Environmental \nAccounting 2022-26, recommending adherence to the System of Environmental Economic \nAccounting – Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) adopted by UN Statistical", "metadata": {"page": 37}}
