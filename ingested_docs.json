    "text": "P\nrinciples for Effective Digital Learning: \nA Review of Literature  \nA\nugust 2018  \nPrepared for: Seattle Public Schools, Seattle, Washington \nBy: John D. Ross, Ph.D. \n1 Executive Summary  \n \nWhile technology has and will continue to change, there are some things that educators can rely \non as constants. There are many things that we, as a community of educators, know about how \npeople learn. We know how to implement effective instruction, and we know how to design \nassessments that actually support learning. There are many decades of research about what \ndoes and doesn\u2019t work well when it comes to helping students achieve their academic potential, \nregardless of the  resources we use to do so. But along with the introduction of the then -new \npersonal computer into our nation\u2019s classrooms, begun in the late 1970s and early 1980s, there \nbegan additional research on the effectiveness of these new technologies. While not o riginally \ndesigned for teaching, many educators were excited about the potential for these technologies \nto take over many educational functions, perhaps even reducing the need for teachers!  \n \n \n \nMuch of the early research, and early practice, on technology  in education suffers from \nmethodological flaws. Early educational technology resources tried to focus on technology \nresources as they would a clinical drug trial, using \u201ctraditional\u201d teaching \u2014whatever that is \u2014as \nthe placebo. Do computers work better than teachers or not? In his now famous treatise on \nreconsidering research on learning from media, Clark (1983) notes that these so- called \u201cmedia \nselection\u201d or \u201cmedia comparison\u201d research design models were asking the wrong question. \nMedia devices available at that time\u2014and still today \u2014by themselves  have no inherent \nproperties that one should assume will influence learning, positively or negatively. As Clark \nnoted, \u201cmedia are mere vehicles that deliver instruction but do not influence student \n2 achievement any mor e than the truck that delivers our groceries cause changes in our nutrition\u201d \n(p. 445). This is still true today. Instead of asking \u201cis it better than\u2026\u201d more recent research \nfocuses on questions like",

Instead of asking \u201cis it better than\u2026\u201d more recent research \nfocuses on questions like \u201cwhen is technology most effective?\u201d  \n \nTechnology has become effective at replacing low -level instructional duties. It can administer \nand score multiple- choice assessments to dozens, even hundreds of students simultaneously in \na fraction of the time it would take any teacher. It can provide up- to-the-minute snapshots of \nstudent progress to relevant teachers, their students, and students\u2019 families in safe and secure \nenvironments with colorful and easy -to-read data reports tracking progress over time. And no \nteacher has the patience to match technology when it comes to presenting and re- presenting \ncontent over and over, whether reading text, watching video, or interacting with animations or \nother media so students can view and review as much content as often as they need to. But \nthese savings in efficiency for l ow-level instructional activities provided by technology have \nactually changed the potential for what teachers can do, when and where learning can occur, \nand with whom. Technology goes beyond automation and makes it possible for teachers and \nstudents to ac cess real -world resources, content, experts, and problems using the same or \nsimilar technologies that professionals use. Going far beyond rudimentary drill -and-practice or \n\u201cread and click\u201d tutorials, teachers can use technology to differentiate instruction to the needs of \nstudents as they engage in rigorous learning where they create new knowledge and information \nrelevant to the content being studied, as well as their lives, interests, and experiences. No \nschool currently has access to technology that can do that on its own. As noted time and again \nthroughout the literature on technology integration, \u201cIt\u2019s more important how you use technology \nthan if you use it\u201d (Cennamo, Ross & Ertmer, 2018, p. 2; Bundick, Quaglia, Corso & Hawood, \n2014; Gurung & Rutledge, 2014), and one of the most important components when using \ntechnology is a skillful teacher ( Darling -Hammond, Zielezinski & Goldman, 2014",

Both frameworks address components related to \ncurriculum planning, motivation, instructional strategies, and managing learning. While the two \nframeworks are important to district leaders in Seat tle, the question posed for this review was \n\u201chow do digital technologies and content resources support best practices in these areas?\u201d This \nliterature provides information and data to explore that question.  \n \nBased on a set of principles derived first out o f the analysis of the crossover between the two \nframeworks and major themes in the literature, the following principles are explored in this \nreview of literature. At the end of the review of literature for each principle are questions for \nconsideration that educators at various levels \u2014classroom, school, program, or district \u2014may \nwant to consider and discuss to determine connections between the literature that supports the \nprinciple and their own practice and philosophies regarding effective digital  learning.  \n 3 Principle 1:  Digital resources promote student achievement for all students, especially \nhistorically underserved students, when students use them to produce information \nrather than passively consume information, but technology use alone is ineffective \nunless mediated by an effective teacher.  \n \nWhat does this principle mean for schools?  \n\u2022 Digital resources are only effective when used appropriately, as evidenced through \ndecades of research. Technology use alone is ineffective unless mediated by an \neffective t eacher. Technology cannot replace the impact of a highly qualified teacher. \nSome technology uses, such as drill -and-practice exercises, programmed instruction, \nusing word- processing software for grammar/punctuation practice",

Technology cannot replace the impact of a highly qualified teacher. \nSome technology uses, such as drill -and-practice exercises, programmed instruction, \nusing word- processing software for grammar/punctuation practice or checks, and \nreading activities that rely on drill or tutorials as negatively impacting student \nachievement.  \n\u2022 Generally, technology will not replace teachers, but it can change what it means to be a \nteacher, and a learner, and it can replace rudimentary or low -level teaching activities . \nTechnology can be a catalyst for learning that can both be used for helping students \ndevelop foundational knowledge and basic skills as well as demonstrate their learning in \nnew ways. New pedagogical models put teachers in the role of activators of learning.  \n\u2022 When used to promote deeper learning through tasks that require students to create \ncontent and produce new information, students \u2014especially historically underserved \nstudents \u2014show greater gains in achievement than when students use digital resources \nto consume information.  \n\u2022 Technology is not culturally neutral. Cultural experiences and backgrounds influence \nboth how technology is perceived or received within a culture as well as the role it is \nexpected to play. When used effectively by a culturally responsive teacher, technology \ncan help move students beyond achieving shallow knowledge attributed to dependent \nlearners to deeper learning in environments that promote critical and creative thinking in \nwhich students become self -directed, independent learners . \n \nPrinciple 2:  Digital resources help teachers develop authentic learning opportunities that \nalign with the depth of rigor of college- and-career ready standards and are relevant and \nmeaningful to students.  \n \nWhat does this principle mean for schools?  \n\u2022 The b est learning occurs when learning is authentic.  To be authentic, learning should \nhave explicit connections to life outside of school \u2014not only in later college and careers, \nbut to students\u2019 current lives outside of school. Authentic intellectual work allows  \nstudents to construct knowledge within a discipline that has value beyond school.  \n\u2022 The ultimate goal of learning is transfer \u2014the application of new knowledge and skills in \na novel or unique setting, preferably a real -world setting.

Instead, deep learning tasks help \nstudents develop the capacities to learn, create, and implement what they have learned.  \n\u2022 New pedagogies that integrate technology are more complex than ongoing trends  and \nfads. They instead incorporate digital resources so that learners can create and use new \nknowledge in the real world,  4  \nPrinciple 3:  Digital resources have and continue to change what \u201cliteracy\u201d and \u201cbeing \nliterate\u201d mean and look like.  \n \nWhat does this principle mean for schools?  \n\u2022 \u201cBeing literate\u201d has always depended upon the prevalent technologies of the day. Digital \ntechnologies are rapidly expanding what it means to be literate through the generation of \nNew Literacies. Students who have limited opportunities to engage with online resources \nand develop new literacies demonstrate lower general literacy abilities than their peers. \nSchools and districts that do not prepare students for these New Literacies are not \npreparing \u201cliterate\u201d students.  \n\u2022 In order to be considered literate, students must not only be able to find and evaluate \ninformation but should be able to create verifiable information using relevant media, \nfollowing accepted standards and practices.  \n \nPrinciple 4: Digital resources can help but alone are insufficient for helping students \nauthentically engage in learning.  \n \nWhat does this principle mean for schools?  \n \n\u2022 Technology can engage students, for a while, but authentic instruction is more likely to \nyield authentic instruction in learning.

These align with \nresearch that suggest successful, student -engaging classrooms combine relevant, real -\nworld situations or constructs; technology -rich environments; and environments where \nteachers are co -learners and there is respectful collaboration between students and \nteachers.  \n \nPrincipl e 5: Digital resources allow students and teachers to connect and collaborate \nwith other students, teachers and other influential adults, and with the content.  \n \nWhat does this principle mean for schools?  \n \n\u2022 Students entering college and careers require strong inter - and intrapersonal \ncommunication skills and the ability to collaborate effectively. In most industries today, \ncommunication and collaboration are either facilitated by or supported by digital \ntechnologies and the new literacies they require.  \n\u2022 Students (and adults) are already connecting through various media.  Schools may see \nit as an obligation to support appropriate means for communicating and collaborating \nwith others using digital technologies, whether synchronously or asynchronously, in 5 order to  prepare students for life outside of school. Today, not just later in college and \ncareers.  \n\u2022 Simply providing access to technology alone will not help students become effective \ncommunicators and collaborators. They need to be taught these skills in supporti ve \nenvironments using the technologies they do and will use outside of school. Ineffective \ngrouping strategies can negatively impact students. Collaborative groups are more \nsuccessful when the group members determine goals for the group, and each individua l \nunderstands their own role in reaching those group goals. Students need to be taught \nhow to communicate and share ideas clearly, listen actively, consider the ideas and \nperspectives of others, and provide constructive feedback that promotes learning and \nmoving towards the group goals  \n \nPrinciple 6:  Digital resources provide opportunities for students to demonstrate mastery \nof learning goals in a variety of ways.  \n \nWhat does this principle mean for schools?  \n \n\u2022 A variety of digital tools and resources are avail able",

Using digital \ntools to support assessment can improve the efficiency in which students and teachers \nengage in assessment of and for learning.  \n\u2022 It is difficult to manage all of the data currently made available through a coherent, \ncomprehensive and continuous assessment system without digital technologies. Digital \ntechnologies make it easy to track individual and groups of students and how they \nperform on assessments that can be linked to content standards or other desired \nlearning out comes, either individual or multiple standards.  \n\u2022 Very little learning can be represented by a dichotomous \u201cgot it or didn\u2019t\u201d accounting \nmindset. Learning progressions are used to describe a well -defined model of how \nstudents might be expected to learn. Instruction based on learning progressions can \nhelp students achieve transfer, the ultimate goal of learning.  \n\u2022 Using a backwards design approach identifies relevant assessments first that then guide \nthe development of curricula, units, and lessons. Determining assessments first can also \ndetermine the types o f resources, such as digital technologies, and supporting skills that \nshould also be addressed during instruction.  \n\u2022 Formative assessment strategies are one of the most effective instructional interventions \nfor promoting student achievement.  \n\u2022 While standardiz ed assessments can incorporate technology to capture and report \nstudent performance data, these assessments are limited by time and testing formats \nwhen trying to assess content standards that require strategic or extended thinking. \nThese standards are oft en assessed at the classroom level and require multiple and \nvaried representations of concepts and tasks.  \n\u2022 Interim assessments can be used to impact student outcomes on later summative \nassessments if they are implemented with fidelity.

When used to provide opportunities for problem, project - or performance -base d \nassessments, interim assessments may help teachers restructure teaching in the \nmoment and provide a more comprehensive picture of student achievement. The more \nclosely assessment is linked to and occurs with instruction, the greater opportunity it has \nto promote student achievement.  \n\u2022 Few assessment experts agree that assessments can be used for multiple purposes. \nThe best assessments are designed to generate data for specific types of purposes and \ndecision making.

This presence, of course, is the proliferation of small, \npowerful, portable computing devices that can access high- quality digital content, information, \nand resources from virtually anywhere learning can occur. Computing devices have been \navailable in classrooms for decades and educators and researchers have been interested in \ntheir potential to support teaching and learning from the time the first personal computer (PC) \nshowed up. Even this author started his teaching career in 1986 with one computer in his \nclassroom after writing a master\u2019s thesis on evaluating the then -new educational software \nbecoming available for the new PC.  \n \nSince then, access to digital devices and content has blossomed and made strides in leveling \nthe playing field for students of all types. This is especially true in schools, which have long \nprovided access to devices and the Internet for students of all backgrounds, i ncluding students \nfrom historically underserved populations who routinely show lower rates of access to \ncomputers or the Internet at home, or who have \u201chandheld- only\u201d access through smartphones. \nWithin 10 years of the launch of the first National Educational Technology Plan ( U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce, 1999 ), schools successfully met and exceeded the expectation that \nschools would achieve a ratio of five students per computer. Within those 10 years, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education ( Gray, Thomas, & Lewis, 2010 ) reported that across the nation\u2019s \nschools a computer was either available in the classroom or could be brought into the \nclassroom at a ratio of 1.7 students per computer, and the Education Superhighway (2018) \nreports that less than 5% of students in Washington state have not met the federal goal for \nbroadband connectivity in their schools. There is and has been no significant difference in terms \nof access to devices and the Internet at schools across the country for students of different \nethnic/racial  backgrounds or gender.

There is and has been no significant difference in terms \nof access to devices and the Internet at schools across the country for students of different \nethnic/racial  backgrounds or gender. Since the data was last collected in 2010, schools have \ncontinued to add laptops, tablets, and other mobile devices in classrooms, labs, or on mobile \ncarts and even encouraged students to use their own technology in \u201cbring- your-own\u201d  programs.  \n \nSchools often take some time to catch up to trends in business and industry, and so it should be \nno surprise that some schools are still grappling with how best to use these ubiquitous \ncomputing devices to support their goals, the role of technology and need for skilled technology \nworkers has grown exponentially in business and industry. Recent trends that have changed the \ndemands of work and life can be directly attributed to increasing automation, globalization, \nworkplace changes, and policies  increase personal responsibility (Jerald, 2009). Business and \ngovernment leaders often use the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \nand its popular STEM acronym to make the call for an increased number of highly skilled \nworkers to address these trends. Many cite the shifting role of workers in many occupations that \nnow need technology skills and knowledge (Bughin, Hazan, Lund, Dahlstr\u00f6m, Wiesinger, \nSubramaniam, 2018), such as healthcare and medicine which usually comprise the bulk of  the 12 fastest growing occupations in the United States (U.S. Department of Labor, 2018), as well as \nthe growing number of new careers that have been made available through technology \ninnovations.  \n \nAuthors for the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and the \nInstitute of Medicine (2011), report that advances in science and engineering are creating a \ndisproportionality in terms of careers available and workers skilled enough to enter them. They \nreported, in 2011, that only 4% of the nation\u2019s workforce is composed of scientists and \nengineers but that \u201cthis group disproportionately creates jobs for the other 96%\u201d (p. 4).

They \ngive examples of new opportunities for careers in medicine to archaeology as a result of \ndeciphering the human genome, and improvements in integrated circuits that has now made \nsome tools such as tape recorders, paper maps, pay phones, and two- dimensional X -rays \nobsolete. They emphasize that it is not simply scientists and engineers that benefit from \ninnovations in technology, it is everyone in the chain of manufacturing, from factory workers, \nadvertisers, delivery personnel, salespeople, people who maintain new products and systems, \nand of course, those who use them benefit. All along this chain, technology is influencing and \nchanging how workers in these and similar positions work.  \n \nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (Fayer, Lacey & Watson, 2017) confirms the growing \nnumber of job openings in STEM occupations as well as a significant gap in available workers. \nThere  were nearly 8.6 million STEM jobs in 2015 and STEM occupations had above- average \ngrowth, growing by 10.5 percent between May 2009 and May 2015. Computer occupations far \noutgrew other areas of STEM and are expected to exceedingly outpace growth in other ST EM \nareas through 2024, which will unfortunately leave a projected gap of more than 1 million job \nopenings in computer occupations alone. Racial minorities and women are traditionally \nunderrepresented in STEM fields (Hansen & Gonzalez, 2014), and policies t hat promote \nincreased participation of these underrepresented groups in STEM fields is one strategy for \nmeeting needs for skilled workers.  \n \nNeither technology skills nor academic content knowledge alone will be sufficient to prepare \ncurrent students for fu ture success in college and careers. In a 2016 survey by PayScale, 44% \nof managers who responded to the survey reported they feel new graduates lack the important \nhard skill of writing proficiency. However, similar and larger percentages of managers felt t hat \nnew graduates were lacking many more soft skills, such as critical thinking/problem solving \n(60%), attention to detail (56%), communication (46%), ownership (44%), and leadership (44%).  \n \nThis development \u2014ubiquitous access to high",

Like many things in educat ion, there is no guarantee that simply \nadding technology to a classroom environment will increase student achievement. As noted \ntime and again throughout the literature on technology integration, \u201cIt\u2019s more important how you \nuse technology than if you use it\u201d (Cennamo, Ross & Ertmer, 2018, p. 2; Bundick, Quaglia, \nCorso & Hawood, 2014; Gurung & Rutledge, 2014).  13 About this review  \n \nThe topics in this review are based on discussions with district leadership in Seattle Public \nSchools and a review of relevant doc uments and artifacts that support the district\u2019s mission. \nCentral to teaching and learning in the district are two frameworks: (1) Charlotte Danielson\u2019s A \nFramework for Teaching and pyramid of pedagogical knowledge based on the Skillful Teacher  \nfrom Resear ch for Better Teaching, Inc. Both frameworks address components related to \ncurriculum planning, motivation, instructional strategies, and managing learning.  The principles \noutlined in this document speak to many of the same areas that the Skillful Teacher  addresses, \nin particular the areas of instructional strategies, curriculum planning and motivation.  A \ncrosswalk between the principles and the key concepts of the Skillful Teacher  may be of use in \nthe future. While the two frameworks are important to dis trict leaders in Seattle, the question \nposed was \u201chow do digital technologies and content resources support best practices in these \nareas?\u201d This literature provides information and data to explore that question.  \n \nBased on a set of principles derived first out of the analysis of the crossover between the two \nframeworks and major themes in the literature, the following principles are explored in this",

After \nreviewing more than 70 recent studies, these researchers did find that \ntechnology \u2014as one component of what \nthey refer to as a \u201cdigital learning ecosystem,\u201d can indeed promote student achievement, especially for historically underserved students. They \nalso emphasize the important roles \nteachers perform in those lear ning \necosystems. These authors report that research indicates three important variables for success in learning when incorporating technology, especially for students considered at -risk. These \nthree important variables are:  \n  \n1. \u201cInteractive learning;  \n2. Use of technology to explore and create rather than to \u2018drill and kill\u2019; and  \n3. The right blend of teachers and technology\u201d (p. 6).  \n  The authors describe interactive learning  as relying on resources that allow students to \nmanipulate and create information and data, such as the use of animations, simulations, data \nvisualizations, games, 3D models, and the generation of new media- based content. McDonald \n(2016) concurs, calling modern digital learning environments as ones that \u201cenable students to develop their technological literacy and critical thinking skills through their daily learning activities\u201d (p. 542) and that digital game- based learning and computer simulations are two digital \n15 learning approaches that have been found to be effective in STEM education classroom s. One \nof the greatest benefits of interactive digital learning resources is that \u201cthey can allow students \nto see and explore concepts from different angles using a variety of representations\u201d (Darling-\nHammond, Zielezinski & Goldman, 2014, p. 7).

The researchers at Stanford specifically \nidentify the use of drill -and-practice activities, programmed instruction, using word- processing \nsoftware for grammar/punctuation practice or checks, and reading activities that rely on drill or \ntutorials as negatively impacting student achievement. Programmed instruction is described as \nwhen students \u201cmarch through material they learn through rote or algorithm.\u201d In these settings, \nstudents can be described as passive consumers  of information, in which they exhibit various \nlevels of interest and enthusiasm while working through screens of text and images and \nparticipating in quizzes of low -level conceptual or procedural knowledge. Unfortunately, these \nineffective uses of technology predominate in schools with a majority of historically underserved \nstudents.  \n \n \n \nThe authors go further to report that research on technology integration indicates that \u201cusing \ncomputers as replacements  for teachers in traditional drill -and-practice exercises has not \nproduced greater success for such students, but that more interactive, proactive, and teacher -\nsupported uses have helped students make strong strides in achievement\u201d (p. 14). They \nemphasize that the teacher is the critical factor in supporting students beyond the use of digital \ncontent, even if that content is adaptive, interactive, and provides feedback to students on their \nperformances. Teachers support students by supplementing their foundational learning, \nexplaining concepts, and coordinating student discussions. These teacher behaviors have been \nshown to be successful in helping low -achieving students pass state competency tests and \nmaster complex new material.  \n \nRather than being passive consumers of content created by others, the research reviewed by \nthese authors (Darling- Hammond et al., 2014) suggest that students learn more when they use \ntechnology to create new content themselves. They note that \u201cstudents demonstrate stronger \nengageme nt, self -efficacy, attitudes toward school, and skill development when they are \nengaged in content creation projects\u201d (p. 9).

Darling- Hammond et \n16 al (2014) report that \u201ca large body of research\u201d has found that well -designed collaborative, \nproblem -based learning activities can have positive impact on inquiry skills, process skills, and \nbuilding knowledge (p. 14). This  finding is corroborated through longitudinal studies on STEM \nPBL projects (Erdogan, Navruz, Younes & Capraro, 2016; Han, Capraro & Capraro, 2014).  \n \n \n \nWhile a continuing thread in teacher perceptions, history has shown time and again that a \nteacher\u2019s fear  of being replaced by a computer has not come true. However, what computers \nand computing devices can  do, is change what it means to be a teacher \u2014and a learner. \nUbiquitous access can shift what teachers do in the classroom. Teachers no longer need to take \ntotal control for dispensing content and providing opportunities for drill and practice. Instead, \ndigital devices and content can be a catalyst for learning that can both be used for helping \nstudents develop foundational knowledge and basic skills as well as demonstrate their learning \nin new ways (Fullan & Langworthy, 2014). According to these education experts and \nresearchers, this change is not just from \u201csage on the stage\u201d to \u201cguide on the side\u201d (or teacher -\nas-facilitator). Instead, they echo the work of  noted educational researcher John Hattie (2008) \nthat a guide on the side does not go far enough.

These teachers take a highly proactive role \nin driving the learning process. They draw from a sophisticated repertoire of strategies and \nmethods to determine appropriate opportunities for the needs of their learners. So, no, \ncomputers can\u2019t replace teachers altogether. They can, however, replace those that do not \nmove beyond providing surface level learning to include opportunities for deeper, authentic \nlearning opportunities. They can replace teachers that do not allow students to tackle real -world \nproblems and phenomena or use the same or similar resources that students will later find in \ncollege and careers.  \n \n17 To give the notion of activator of learning some context, Hattie\u2019s (2008) well known findings from \na review of more than 800 meta- analyses (and a subsequent 100+ in later publications) of \neducational factors that claim to improve student outcomes compare the documented impact \nfrom both: teacher -as-facilitator and teacher -as-activator of learning. In reviewing the effect size \nof both categories, Hattie\u2019s team found a significant positive effect for teachers as activators, \nwhich is characterized by strong teacher -student relations hips, incorporating reciprocal \nteaching, providing relevant feedback, and promoting metacognition.

Hattie \nfurther notes that the mo st effective teachers view their role as seeing themselves as evaluators \nof their effects on students, and do so based on their knowledge of their learners and knowing \nenough about the content to provide meaningful learning opportunities at an appropriate level of \nchallenge. Teachers further make learning visible by sharing and helping students understand \nwhat the goals for learning (learning intentions) are and how students will know they have \nmastered those goals (success criteria). Creating an environmen t that encourages students to \nbecome less dependent learners and more independent through strong student -teacher \nrelationships also aligns with promoting culturally relevant learning as described by Hammond \n(2015).  \n \n18 Hattie\u2019s research resulted in six \u201csignposts\u201d of excellence in education that clearly emphasize \nthe valuable role of teachers in the classroom and the importance of students becoming \ncreators of content and producers of information (see signpost 5, specifically).

The co- design of learning is a thread that \ncontinues throughout this review.  \n2. The teacher as a source of human, social, and decisional capital in the learning \nexperience.  All teachers come to a learning setting with human capital, which can be \nincreased by engaging through continuous learning with other educators within and \nbeyond their building to reflect on and hone their craft. Social capital is derived from the \nrelationships teachers have with students, families, other educators, and people outside \ntheir organizations. A teacher with high social capital is better equipped to design \nlearning opportunities that are relevant to their students and connects to the resources of \na larger social network th at brings real -world connections into learning. Decisional \ncapital grows as teachers develop human and social capital. It manifests itself in terms \nof decisions teachers make with individual students based on their needs.  \n3. Teachers as partners in learning w ith students, accelerated by technology.  \nTeachers as co -learners or partners in learning is another thread that is woven \nthroughout this review that can support student achievement outcomes when using \ntechnology. These authors acknowledge that \u201cstrong, supportive, personal\u201d relationships \nbetween teachers and students can promote learning for all students. While ubiquitous \ntechnologies now help to make and support those relationships by connecting students, \nteachers, and others within and beyond the classroom to support learning, they also \nconcur that technology alone is insufficient for promoting deeper learning. While \ntechnology does provide access to varied learning opportunities, they too caution \nagainst technology through digital curricula being used to provide only \u201csurface \nknowledge,\u201d and that supportive relationships are necessary for moving beyond limited, \nisolated knowledge acquisition.  \n \nHattie (2012) reinforced some of these principles in his \ufffd",

These three levels are (1) surface knowledge \nnecessary to comprehend basic information, vocabulary, processes, and strategies, (2) deeper \nunderstandings of how information, rules, and processes relate to each other that expand their \nunderstandings, and (3) the conceptual thinking that \u201callows surface and deep knowledge to \nturn into conjectures and concepts upon which to build new surface and deep understandings\u201d \n(p. 86). He calls for less emphasis on the overwhelming predominance of surface level learning \nin many classrooms and a balance between surface and deep learning that allows students to \nmore successfully engage in conceptual thinking that becomes the foundation for further \nlearning.  \n \nHammond (2015) provides support for the importance of teachers as activators of learning \nthrough the lens of culturally responsive teaching. She encourages teachers to develop a \nculturally responsive mindset , recognizing how students\u2019 cultures influence the ways they learn \nand making meaning. These teachers use cultural knowledge to co- learn with students who are \nthen encouraged to develop the cognitive skills and habits of mind that move them from being \ndependent  learners to independent  learners in which students develop their intellective capacity, 20 which she notes is influenced by one\u2019s culture. She reports that a disproportionate number of \nstudents are dependent learners, meaning that they have not had suff icient access to learning \nopportunities that allow them \u201cto do complex, school -oriented learning tasks such as \nsynthesizing and analyzing informational text without continuous support\u201d (loc. 389).

Hammond emphasizes, \n\u201cto be able to direct their own lives and define success for themselves, they must be able to \nthink critically and creatively\u201d (loc. 419).  \n \nBecause technology pervades so many aspects of our lives, many may erroneously perceive \ndigital technologies as culturally neutral ( Gunawardena, C. N., & McIsaac, M. S., 2004). Just \nbecause we may see phones or computers at home, work, school and on television and movies, \ncultural responses to technology can vary. \u201cCulture interacts with educational technology both in \nterms of cultural  influences on how educational technology is conceptualized and implemented, \nand in terms of how educational technology is experienced and received\u201d (Bradshaw, p 20). \nTherefore, technology itself has cultural influences and its use an be influenced by the cultural \nexperiences of students. It should also be viewed through a culturally responsive lens when it is \nintegrated into learning environments, especially when it is  the learning environment. \nMcLoughlin (in Gunawardena, C. N., & McIsaac, M. S., 2004) has  developed a framework \nbased on experiences in online learning that links culturally inclusive technology -enhanced \nlearning with authentic curriculum and assessments. While originally designed for online \ncourses, the pervasive nature of online interactions  in both physical and virtual classrooms \nmake these suggestions applicable across a range of learning environments.

Validate the learners\u2019 pre- existing knowledge with relevant activities.  When using \ntechnology, instructors should take steps to determine the pre -existing knowledge \nlearners possess, whether in terms of the content, technology, or cultural experiences. \nThey suggest incorporating activities t hat allow instructors and learners to get to know \neach other better can be helpful, especially when interactions are held online, whether in \nclass or at a distance.

Provide comprehensive and multi -dimensional learning opportunities.  These \nresearchers suggest that student engagemen t can be fostered through the use of high-\ncognitive demand tasks and to not make assumptions about English language learners \nor students with learning disabilities being unable to address cognitively complex tasks. \nMany technologies lend themselves easily to providing scaffolds, various forms of \nrepresenting or presenting information, and different opportunities for students to work \ntogether and share and reflect upon their learning. These researchers suggest providing \njob aids and scaffolds for collaborati ve group work online, such as guides for conducting \ngroup work, a group activity, and social activities that help the group learn about and \nsupport each other.  \n3.

Empower students through liberatory leadership opportunities.  Liberatory \nleadership opportunities allow students to provide input into the design and delivery of \ninstructional activities or course components. Students can lead group or class \ndiscussions or may be able to provide input as to how they prefer to achieve learning \noutcomes by choosing or suggesting their own ideas for activities and methods of \nassessment.  \n \n \n \nMany digital curriculum resources are now available that provide varied opportunities for \nstudents to develop surface knowledge and skills, what Hammond describes as \u201cshallow \nknowledge.\u201d More recent adapt ive curricula go beyond static programmed instruction with \nlimited presentation of content and assessment opportunities. Adaptive curricula provide greater \nflexibility for placing students within a learning progression that is better matched to their current \nlevels of ability, sometimes through the use of a pre- assessment and ongoing monitoring of \nlearning. It is important to note, however, the central finding in this section is that while digital \ncurriculum can play a part in acquiring surface or shallow k nowledge, helping students become \nindependent learners that develop deeper understandings and connections to the world outside \nof the classroom occurs most effectively only when expanded upon or enriched by teachers.  \n  \n22  \nWhat does good digital curriculum then look like?

These types of curriculum resources are more sophisticated \nthan earlier pro grammed instruction referenced by Darling -Hammond et al (2014) that \ncan only require students to complete the same sequence over and over, never \nproviding individualized feedback to improve understanding and performance. It\u2019s \nimportant to emphasize again t hat even adaptive curricula are best used in conjunction \nwith a knowledgeable teacher who, with the learner, can review data from digital \ncurriculum and determine appropriate extensions beyond the software that promote \n\u201ccollaborative inquiry and knowledge construction\u201d (p. 14).  \n\u2022 Interactive.  Digital content can be interactive through the interactions between learners, \ninstructors, and the content including: (1) interactions between instructors and learners, \n(2) interactions between learners, and (3) interact ions with the content by learners.

Technology \nuse alone is ineffective unless \nmediated by a skillful teacher. \nTechnology cannot replace the \nimpact of a highly effective \nteacher, but highly skilled \nteachers are best prepared to \nleverage the potential for \ntechnology. Some technology \nuses, such as drill -and-practice \nexercises, programmed \ninstruction, using word-\nprocessing software for \ngrammar/punctuation practice or \nchecks, and reading activities \nthat rely on drill or tutorials have \nbeen found to negatively impact \nstudent achievement.  \n\u2022 Generally, technology will not replace teachers, but it can change what it means to be a \nteacher,  and a learner, and it can replace rudimentary or low -level teaching activities. \nTechnology can be a catalyst for learning that can both be used for helping students \ndevelop foundational knowledge and basic skills as well as demonstrate their learning in \nnew ways. New pedagogical models put teachers in the role of activators of learning.  \n\u2022 When used to promote deeper learning through tasks that require students to create \ncontent and produce new information, students \u2014especially historically underserved \nstudent s\u2014show greater gains in achievement than when students use digital resources \nto consume information.  \n\u2022 Technology is not culturally neutral.

Learners \nof all ages should understand why they are being asked to learn something and how and why it \nis important in their own lives, either currently or in the future in college or careers.  \n \nCennamo, Ross & Ertmer (2018) suggest that authentic instruction is characterized by a shared \nset of five characteristics. Authentic instruction may also be referred to as engaged learning, \nlearning by design, or student -centered instruction. The five characteristics that categorize \nauthentic instruction as described by these authors are:  \n  \n1. Authentic instruction provides for, and builds on, learner autonomy.  While there \nare many ways to do this, a key aspect is allowing learners to pursue topics and \nquestions that they are interested in and find relevant. In other words, connecting \nlearning opportunities to the interests, abilities, experiences, and needs of st udents can \npromote authentic engagement in learning.  \n2. Authentic instruction is based on active, experiential learning.  The most natural \nform of learning involves active, hands -on, concrete experiences. Active learning implies \nthat learners are mentally  active, not just physically moving about the room or a learning \nenvironment. Learners are mentally active when they are manipulating information, \nsynthesizing data, making interpretations, and reflecting upon and articulating what they \nare learning and have learned. When learners engage in this metacognitive approach to \nlearning, they achieve a deeper understanding and are more likely to use new \nknowledge and skills in different situations, which is referred to as transfer  (see below).  \n3. Authentic instruction is holistic. Authentic instruction engages learners in developing \nknowledge and skills within the context of meaningful activities. They are meaningful to \nthe content",

Authentic instruction engages learners in developing \nknowledge and skills within the context of meaningful activities. They are meaningful to \nthe content, the learner, and to situations outside of school that they might find in college \nand career s. Digital resources are especially well suited to providing learners the \n25 opportunity to engage in holistic activities either with a real -world context or in actual \nreal-world settings.  \n4. Authentic instruction incorporates real -world and complex problems.  Learning that \nis situated in real -world situations is not only often more engaging to students but \nincreases the likelihood that learners will be able to transfer their knowledge and skills to \nnew situations. Authentic instruction incorporates learning oppor tunities that require \nlearners to think, develop deep understandings, and apply new knowledge and skills to \nrealistic, important problems.  \n5. Authentic instruction is challenging. Appropriate challenge varies by individual. Just \nas with Vygotsky\u2019s famous Zone of Proximal Development, authentic instruction provides \ndevelopmentally appropriate challenges to learners that they can accomplish with effort \nand supports. Appropriate challenge is the \u201cjust right\u201d challenge that is not too hard, \nwhich can lead to frust ration, yet not too simple for learners, which can result in boredom \nand disengagement.  \n  \nNewmann, Bryk & Nagaoka (2007) developed a framework to describe authentic intellectual \nwork  (AIW) as a means to shape learning opportunities that are meaningful, sig nificant, and \nworthwhile. The AIW framework consists of three characteristics. They are:  \n  \n1. Construction of knowledge. Authentic settings, such as workplaces, often pose unique \nand often complex problems that may not have one clear solution. In these settings, \nskilled adults are required to have a repertoire of knowledge and skills to address these \ncomplex or non -routine problems. While grappling with non- routine problems \u2014which \ncan be brought into most classrooms \u2014the framework developers propose that people \nconstruct new knowledge by working through the problem situation by organizing, \ninterpreting, evaluating, and/or synthesizing prior knowledge.",

Foundational knowledge \nand skills are better developed in these contexts rather than isolated.  \n2. Disciplined inquir y. The authors acknowledge it is important that learners have a base \nof prior knowledge in a content area (e.g., facts, vocabularies, concepts, theories, \nalgorithms and other conventions) from which to draw upon in order to successfully \nconstruct knowledge when faced with non- routine problems. The authors suggest prior \nknowledge is necessary in order to address the complexity in unknown situations and to \ninterpret information, propose hypotheses, and test solutions grounded in what one does \nknow and what one is learning from the situation.  \n3. Value beyond school.  Successfully completing a learning or assessment activity should \nnot be in and of itself the primary goal of learning. Instead, successful learning \nopportunities should be meaningful beyond compliance in the classroom. The AIW \nFramework suggests that student work should have impact on others.  \n  \nThe term \u201cdeep\u201d is often associated with descriptions of authentic instruction. Deep not only \nrefers to academic learning but can also include affective, behavioral, and social -emotional \noutcomes. The phrase deeper learning  (Hewlett Foundation, 2013) is one that has been \nchampioned by those that encourage the use of authentic learning opportunities that are \nrelevant and meaningful to the interests, experiences, and abilities of learners as well as to the \nsubject matter, and how that subject matter is applied outside of school in college, careers, or \nour personal lives.

Mastering core academic content.  Learners develop a foundation of knowledge and \nskills within a domain by being given multiple opportunities to apply knowledge in a \nrange of challenging tasks. Similar to the AIW framework, deeper learning suggests that \nlearners are able to draw upon and use foundational knowledge and skills to complete \nmeaningful work within a content domain or subject area as they are found in the real \nworld.  \n2. Thinking critically and solving complex problems.  Meaningful work is often framed \nby complex problems within or across domains and requires learners to engage in \ncritical and creative thinking and persist through challenges. Critical and creative thinking \nare best taught by incorporating the tools and techniques relative to the area of study, \nmeaning that while doctors, musicians, and game designers all engage in critical \nthinking and problem solving, the tools and techniques they use are shaped by their \nareas of expertise.  \n3. Working collaboratively.  Learners \ncollaborate with others to address \nacademic , social, vocational and \npersonal challenges and problems. \nCollaborating requires learners to \nincorporate multiple points of view to \nreach consensus and meet individual \nand group goals.  \n4. Communicating effectively. \nLearners should be able to organize \ntheir i deas, information, and thoughts \nand communicate them to relevant \naudiences in ways that their \nmessages are meaningful and \nunderstood.  \n5. Learning how to learn.  In essence, deeper learning can occur when learners engage in \nself-directed learning (see Principle  3). Self -directed learning strategies can  be taught \nand can be encouraged in situational contexts so learners can use them to persist \nthrough challenges.  \n6. Developing academic mindsets.

Developing academic mindsets. As the work of Carol Dweck (2007) ha s clearly \nshown, personal beliefs and attitudes about one\u2019s self and how one can be a successful \nlearner are malleable. Learners can develop positive mindsets about learning and use \nthem to reach their own goals and produce high- quality work.  \n27 Newman and hi s colleagues (2007) also use the term \u201cdeep\u201d when referring to the level of \nsophistication learners should be exposed to and construct during learning (see Principle 1). \nThey suggest that knowledge is deep when learners are able to understand and share det ails, \ndistinctions, nuances, and different applications of the concepts being studied. Their knowledge \nin this case is holistic rather than superficial or thin. In order to develop deep knowledge, \nstudents are engaged in substantive conversations with others, whether other students, \neducators, or those outside of the classroom. These conversations are a means for students to \ndetermine how their learning has value beyond school and to construct knowledge through \ndiscourse. The AIW framework encourages making connections between subject matter \nknowledge and skills to public problems or personal experiences that learners have faced or will \nface in the future. Making connections to the world beyond the classroom builds on learners\u2019 \npersonal experiences in order to help demonstrate how their learning can have some impact.  \n \n  \n \nFullan and Langworthy (2014) describe how teachers can incorporate \u201cdeep learning tasks\u201d in \norder to  reach the complex, and multi -faceted outcomes often associated with authentic learning \nopportunities.

In reviewing deep learning tasks in action, the authors report that \ndeep learning tasks do result in knowledge construction, sim ilar to how it is defined by the AIW \nframework. Deep learning tasks often leverage the power of digital technologies and resources, \nand many incorporate the social nature of learning through collaborative work. These authors \nsuggest that \u201cwhen pedagogical and deep learning capacities are clearly defined and \ndeveloped, digital tools and resources enable the: 1) discovery and mastery of new content \nknowledge; 2) collaborative, connected learning; 3) low -cost creation and iteration of new \nknowledge; 4) use of new knowledge with authentic audiences for \u2018real\u2019 purposes; and 5) \nenhancement of teachers\u2019 ability to put students in control of the learning process, accelerating \nlearner autonomy\u201d (p. 33).  \n28 As noted previously, digital resources have become commonplace f or obtaining foundational \nknowledge and developing basic skills in many content areas.

Authentic intellectual work \nallows students to construct knowledge within a discipline that has value beyond school.  \n\u2022 The ultimate goal of learning is transfer \u2014the application of new knowledge and skills \nin a novel or unique setting, preferably a real -world setting. Mastering core content is \nimportant but insufficient for transfer in most cases. Instead, deep learning tasks help students develop the capacities to learn, create, and implement what they have \nlearned.  \n\u2022 New pedagogies that integrate technology are more complex than ongoing trends \nand fads. They instead incorporate digital res ources so that learners can create and \nuse new knowledge in the real world.  \n \n  \n29  \nPrinciple 3: Digital resources have and continue to change what \u201cliteracy\u201d and \n\u201cbeing literate\u201d mean and look like.  \n \nWhat it means to be \u201cliterate\u201d continues to evolve yet always has a symbiotic relationship tied to \nprevalent technologies of the day. Once only the provenance of the wealthy, literacy evolved \nwhen people beyond the aristocracy and religious leaders were given the opportunity to interact with the new technologies of paper and pen. The printing press and the ability to mass generate tomes pushed the concept of being literate forward again, along with the generation of a new \n\u201cmiddle class\u201d that could use their literacy skills to support their careers and advance their  \nstation. Schools in this country were established, in part, to help create a literate population that \nwas able to engage in the democratic ideal of following one\u2019s dream and contributing to society. It was during the first half of the 20\nth century when \u201cbeing literate\u201d was determined to go beyond \nreading",

It was during the first half of the 20\nth century when \u201cbeing literate\u201d was determined to go beyond \nreading and writing to encompass the skills of listening and speaking (Hobbs, 2016). Then came \nradio, and film, television, mass media, and the Internet, and the concept of literacy continued to \nevolve throughout,  but now at a much more rapid pace.  \n  Reading and writing are still foundational literacy skills, but many conclude that \nthey are insufficient for being considered \nliterate any longer. Reading and writing can be accomplished with traditional texts, but even the concept of what \nconstitutes a \u201ctext\u201d has expanded, and \nmany acknowledge that text includes a variety of media formats with which people communicate, collaborate, debate, and share ideas. The digital \n\u201ctexts\u201d we all interact with on a daily basis in t he 21\nst century cannot be limited simply to static \ntext and pictures. Hobbs (2011) notes that the term \u201ctext\u201d can be expanded to include \u201cany form \nof expression or communication in fixed and tangible form that uses symbol systems, including language, still and moving images, graphic design, sound, music, and interactivity\u201d (p. 14 ). The \ndynamic forms of \u201ctext\u201d are especially relevant now as people can create their own texts in which they embody or impart interactive elements to \u201ctext\u201d through videos, simulations, applications, and gaming environments. Indeed, the term \u201cliteracy\u201d can be expanded to include \nsocial interactions and \u201ctraces\u201d of social interactions that are recorded, reported, and available for asynchronous analysis.  \n Several literacy experts note that digital technologies provide students various approaches to developing and sharing knowledge that are different from more traditional approaches to literacy, even from just a few decades ago. The way that new digital technologies impact our \nlives, and the way we learn through and with them, are often described as the theory of New \nLiteracies (Leu et al., 2014; Sweeney, 2010).

There are what some refer to as \u201clowercase\u201d new \n30 literacies  that relate to different digital technologies and the ways that they are us ed (e.g., \ntexting, social networking, using an online search engine). Many of these new literacies are \nplatform dependent. In contrast, \u201cuppercase\u201d New Literacies represent skills and knowledge that \nmanifest themselves across a range of technology -specific  modalities (e.g., reading and \ncomprehending online information, navigating digital environments, curating information in \nvarious media formats). New Literacies acknowledge that the digital technologies we interact \nwith encourage us to develop new knowledg e and express ourselves in unique ways when \nusing technology. The same was true with the first papyrus and pencil, and it now continues \nwith social media, web- based interactions, and real -time interactions with people at a distance.  \n \nSeveral researchers have noted that interacting with texts online varies from how we interact \nwith offline texts, and this impacts what it means to be literate. For example, much of the \nreading and writing we do online is related to finding and sharing information. \u201cWhere shoul d we \ngo to dinner?\u201d \u201cWhat car should I buy?\u201d \u201cHow does Western migration in the late 19th Century \nimpact me today?\u201d All of these questions prompt us to interact in an interconnected online \nenvironment through computers, tablets, phones and other devices that contain embedded links \nand connected information across sources. It requires different literacy skills to read, \nsummarize, and share the information we\u2019ve found. Students need opportunities to express \nthemselves with this variety of media\u2014digital text, images, videos, and others. Restricting or \nwithholding these opportunities for students to interact with and develop New Literacies (and \nnew literacies) can have negative consequences for students, especially those students in \nschools that are designated as high poverty compared to those in more affluent schools (Leu et \nal., 2014).

Research has shown that students who have limited opportunities to engage with \nonline resources often demonstrate lower general reading and writing abilities than their \ncounterpa rts. \n \nLiteracy in the digital age is multi -faceted. There may be no one metric to determine if one is \nliterate. Hobbs (2016) provides a panoply of interrelated terms, such as visual literacy, \ninformation literacy, media literacy, and computer literacy, and news literacy as examples of the \nrange of skills necessary for people in a digital age to access, analyze, evaluate, and create \ninformation using a variety of texts, genres, tools, and technologies. Even terms like author, \naudience, context, and text have also expanded from their earlier formulation focused on writers \nand writing towards the inclusion of forms of expression and communication that include visual, \naudiovisual, sound, interactive, and digital formats and modes\u201d (p. 9). New Literacies demand \nthat students demonstrate a combination of cognitive and social competencies, knowledge, and \nskills needed to understand communication and communicate effectively with others.  \n \nIn addition to finding, evaluating, and synthesizing information, New Literacies  demand that \nstudents produce or develop new information that others can access, verify, and use. The \nPartnership for 21st Century Learning (2016) describes information literacy as having two parts \nor stages: (1) accessing and evaluating information, and ( 2) using and managing information. In \nthe first stage, students are consumers of information, and in the second, students use the \ninformation they have found to become creators of information. In the current century, we \nengage in these two stages using a v ariety of media\u2014often through the use of digital tools.  31 The inclusion of two stages suggests that evaluating information is not sufficient to be \nconsidered literate in an information economy \u2014one in which information can easily be \ngenerated and disseminated.

Because of this, many new learning opportunities are \nmade possible through digital technologies, such as mobile learning, ubiquitous learning \n(anytime, anywhere lear ning), and collaborative learning with social media. On the other hand, \nSkeptics promote the \u201cfear argument\u201d that poses that students use personal technology \ndifferently than they would in academic settings, and their basic technology use does not \ntransfer  well in learning environments.

According to several \nresearchers (Bundick, Quaglia, Corso & Haywood, 2014; Lawson, 2017; Parsons & Taylor, \n2011), the interest in observing and promoting student engagement as a construct in education \nbecame popular in the 1980s but  has shifted over time.

Or are students authentically engaged in learning \nbecause they see it  is relevant and important to their lives? As the literature on engagement \nevolves, one\u2019s concept of engagement should be clearly described so that appropriate data can \nbe collected to determine if students are truly engaged, with or without technology.  \n \nEarly indicators for student engagement included items such as fewer discipline referrals and \nabsences and increased graduation rates.

Indications of Emotional \nEngagement expanded the construct to \ninclude psychological or affectiv e indicators \nthat attempted to measure the value students \nperceived for school, their sense of belonging \nor their motivation or interest in school \nactivities in and beyond the classroom. Over \ntime the connection between student engagement and student achievement, sometimes \nreferred to as Cognitive or Intellectual Engagement , have become more closely linked \n(Larson, 2017; Parsons & Taylor, 2011).  \n \nIn a review of a large- scale implementation of a multidimensional framework of student \nengagement in 17 school districts in Canada, the What did you do in school today? Framework \nfor Student Engagement describes three components of the engagement construct (Dunleavy, \nMilton & Crawford, 2010; Willms, Friesen, & Milton, 2009):  \n \n1. Social Engagement.

These best increase student engagement when they are leveraged to provide learning opportunities that meet the \nother five characteristics, such as relevant and challenging problem -based learning \nopportunities that connect beyond the classroom.  \n5. Engaging and Challenging Instruction.  Numerous researchers studying student \nengagement report that students prefer appropriately challenging instruction in which \nthey are held to high expectations. Engagement is promoted through engaging \npedagogy and engaging curriculum, that requires both teachers and students to take \nsome risk in an environment that supports learning from mistakes and even allowing \nstudents to have greater say in designing their own learning.  \n6. Authentic Assessment.  As described earlier, engagement is increased when \nassessment contributes to learning and helps teachers improve learning opportunities rather than being used to summatively audit student knowledge and skills.  \n \nWhat does this principle mean for schools? \n \n\u2022 Technology can engage students, for a while, but authentic instruction is more likely to \n",

Without \nauthentic learning opportunities, technology can also lead to ritual compliance, \nretreatism, and even rebellion.  \n\u2022 Students report a wide range of outcomes related to the highest levels of engagement. These go beyond simply using technology and include indicators such as solving real \nproblems, being respected, and making a difference in the w orld. These align with \nresearch that suggest successful, student -engaging classrooms combine relevant, real -\nworld situations or constructs; technology -rich environments; and environments where \nteachers are co -learners and there is respectful collaboration between students and \nteachers.\n  39 Principle 5: Digital resources allow students and teachers to connect and \ncollaborate with other students, teachers and other influential adults, and with the content.  \n \n \n \nMany lists that describe key skills for graduates developed by educators, policymakers, and business and industry leaders usually include the categories of communication and collaboration (Jerald, 2009; National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2017; NRC, 2012; \nOECD 2017), including those that describe deep learning (Hewlett Foundation, 2013) and a \nrange of soft skills often called 21\nst Century Skills (Partnership for 21st Century Skills. 2015). \nStudents entering college and careers (and many would correctly argue even before then) require strong inter - and intrapersonal skills that allow them to communicate their ideas at least \nverbally and in writing.

Peer influences ( d =  .53) are also \nhigh and, Hattie notes, \u201ccan be much higher indeed if some of the negative influences of peers is mitigated\u201d (p. 87).  \n Effective collaboration is not synonymous with \u201cgroup work.\u201d In fact, ineffective grouping strategies can have negative effects on students who then may try to avoid group work.

In other words, for students to \ncollaborate successfully, they have to be taught how to communicate effectively with everyone \non the team; negotiate potential solut ions when problems arise; and establish processes for \nmanaging their work (e.g., setting personal and team goals, determining roles and workloads, \nand monitoring how well individuals and teams are progressing toward goals) (Cennamo, Ross \n& Ertmer, 2018).  \n \nJohnson and Johnson (1991) described the \nprinciples of effective cooperative learning \nthat allows students to reach \ncommunication, collaboration, and \nacademic outcomes. It has been used in a \nrange of different subject areas and with \nstudents with diverse characteristics \nincluding English language learners, \nstudents of all ability levels including those \nwith identified learning disabilities, along \nwith students who require enrichment. In \norder for cooperative learning to be \nsuccessful, students develop and use inter - \nand intrapersonal communication skills and \ngroup processes that allows them to reach \npersonal academic goals while contributing \nto the goals of the group.  \n \nEffective cooperative learning relies on five key elements:  \n \n1. Positive interdependence.  Students in the group have to work together to accomplish \ngoals for the group. The work of the group should be greater than what individuals can \naccomplish together, so it is important that students establish their own personal \nlearning goals as well as goal s for the group. As noted above, Wiliam (2011) \nemphasizes the need for group goals and individual accountability to promote effective \ncollaboration in groups. Just as in work groups or teams, students are given or request \nroles to help the group be success ful. Students need to understand their role and how \ntheir work contributes to the group. Wiliam (2011) cautions that to help promote \nindividual accountability, no single student should be assigned the role of \u201creporter.\u201d \nInstead, every student is responsible for reporting out on the work of the group.  \n2.

Depending on their prior experiences with \ngroup work, students may need to be taught communication and social skills that allow \nthe group to work effectively. This req uires being able to communicate and share ideas \nclearly, listen actively, consider the ideas and perspectives of others, and provide \nconstructive feedback that promotes learning and moving towards the group goals. \n41 Simply placing students in groups will not  yield these complex interpersonal \ncommunication skills. Students may start with structured protocols for taking turns, \nsentence stems for asking questions of the group, and project plans or structured \nagendas. Eventually, students can determine the best w ays to interact and monitor the \neffectiveness of their strategies.  \n3. Individual accountability.  While the group is working on a larger goal, every student is \nresponsible for specific learning outcomes, often academic outcomes based on content \nstandards, but sometimes affective, behavioral, or social -emotional outcomes. \nAccountability implies assessment, and students can engage in self - and peer -\nassessments as well as those administered by the teacher within or outside of the group \nprocess to monitor and evaluate student success. While progress on content standards \nshould always be assessed, many educators also assess the effectiveness of the group \nwork and the processes they incorporated. Some teachers may incorporate group \ncontracts that clearly describe the roles each team member is to play and the outcomes \nthey are expected to reach.  \n4. Promoting one another\u2019s success.  Because success of the group depends on each \nindividual, team members should incorporate methods and strategies that motivate, \nencourage, acknow ledge, and congratulate other members of the team. As with other \ngroup strategies, these may need to be modeled and taught, perhaps even drawing from \nstrategies used during whole class instruction.  \n5. Group processing.  Work teams have established processes. Managers shape the work \nand monitor the work of others to determine if the group will meet expected milestones. \nOther workers have to know how to ask for help, request information from others, and to \nshare their work outcomes appropriately.

Some of this can be modeled during whole \nclass instruction. For example, if the whole class has developed norms for how students \nbehave and work in class, group members may choose to bring some of these norms to \ntheir group to facilitate interactions with each other. Som etimes, groups may also need \nto have mediation or conflict resolution skills that allow them to address issues that come \nup within the group. Conflict resolution may sometimes require an outside mediator (aka \nthe teacher) and, in some models, may result in the \u201cfiring\u201d of a group member who \ncannot meet individual and group responsibilities.  \n \nKeeping groups small, from three to five students, is a recommended strategy for effective \ngroup work (Johnson & Johnson, 1991). Just as work teams are not randomly generated, there \nshould be a purpose for determining group make up. Mixed groups often work well, but some \ntasks may require heterogenous grouping based on ability or other factors. Some teachers \nincorporate frameworks to identify student traits or characteri stics (e.g., Gardner\u2019s Multiple \nIntelligences) to generate a mix of students. Others ask students to \u201capply\u201d for different positions \nin groups. Teachers should monitor grouping strategies and determine the best strategies for \ndifferent purposes.  \n \nSimply giving students access to technologies will not necessarily result in collaboration. \nHowever, just as in the world of work, school work groups can rely on a range of collaborative \ndigital resources to support their work if they are taught how to use them to facilitate effective \ncommunication and collaboration.

In most industries today, \ncommunication and collaboration are either facilitated by or supported by digital \ntechnologies and the new literacies they require.  \n\u2022 Students (and adults) are already connecting through various media.  Schools may see \nit as an obligation to support appropriate means for communicating and collaborating with others using digital technologies, whether synchronously or asynchronously, in \norder to prepare students for life outside of school. Today, not just later in college and \ncareers.  \n\u2022 Simply providing access to technology alone will not help students become effective \ncommunicators and collaborators. They need to be taught these skills in supportive environments using the technologies they do and will use outside of school. Ineffective \ngrouping strategies can negatively impact students. Collaborative groups are more \nsuccessful when the group members determine goals for the group, and each individual \nunderstands their own role in reaching those group goals. Students need to be taught \nhow to communicate and share ideas clearly, listen actively, consider the ideas and perspectives of others, and provide constructive feedback that promotes learning and \nmoving towards the group goals.   \n43 Principle 6: Digital resources provide opportunities for students to demonstrate \nmastery of learning goals in a variety of ways.  \n \nStudents demonstrate mastery of learning goals through a variety of formal and informal  \nassessments.

Assessment experts (Heritage, 2010; Herman & Baker, 2005; Herman, Osmundson, & Dietel, 2010; NRC, 2001) suggest that educators take a balanced approach to classroom and school assessment that includes short - (formative), \nmedium - (interim), and long- cycle (summative) assess ments. The number and type of digital \nresources available to support educators along all three cycles of assessment continue to increase. Digital technologies support more effective and efficient monitoring of student learning, along with the collection and reporting of student data that help teachers make decisions to adjust teaching, when necessary, to meet the needs of students. Collecting data \nfrom multiple measures of assessment has found its way into national policy with the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,  currently referred to as the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act  (Pub. L. 114 -95), that allows states flexibility to develop new \nassessment designs, such as interim assessments offered throughout the course of the year that lead to a single summative score.  \n \n \n The National Research Council (2001) describes a quality assessment system as one that is coherent, comprehensive, and continuous.

A continuous  system is, as the term applies, applied continuously throughout the \nyear to monitor learning and adjust teaching and learning opportunities rather than simply \nauditing learning after the fact. It is difficult to manage all of the data currently made available through a coherent, comprehensive and continuous assessment system without digital technologies.

Learning progressions can be described at various grain sizes. Macro learning \nprogressions, what some may refer  to as \u201cupper -case Learning Progressions,\u201d describe \ncommon sequences that most learners are likely to follow to achieve sig nificant learning \noutcomes within a curriculum or series of courses. These learning progressions are often \nconfirmed by empirical studies and have led to the development of national standards that \ndescribe learning progressions within and across years of s tudy (Gotwals, 2018).  \n \nLearning progressions can be \nconstructed at ever finer grain sizes \ndown to the sequence that describes \nhow students are likely to learn a \nparticular skill, set of related skills, or a \nbank of knowledge. These can be \naccomplished over a lesson or series of \nlessons and while teachers make their \nbest-informed decision about how \nlearning progressions unfold, individual \nstudents bring their own prior \nexperiences  and understandings, \nmisunderstandings, ways of thinking, \nand abilities that can impact the actual \nprogression they take.

Ultimately, however, students should reach the \ndesired learning goals regardless of the path they take.  \n \nAuthors for the National Research Council (2012) suggest best practices encourages teachers \nto first design measures  (assessments) to determine how learners will demonstrate their new \nknowledge and skills before designing activities within curricula, units, or lessons. In other \nwords, incorporating a \u201cbackwards design\u201d instructional design model can help to provide thos e \nvaluable models and examples that learners require to guide their learning along their \nprogression and can help determine (1) what kinds of assessments are appropriate, and (2) the \nlearning opportunities that are necessary for students to be successful on those assessments. \nDetermining assessments first can also determine the types of resources, such as digital \ntechnologies, and supporting skills that should also be addressed during instruction.

Use summative assessments to frame meaningful performance goals.  Letting \nstudents know, at the onset of a unit of study, how they will be assessed helps them set \ngoals and understand what they need to know and be able to do.  \n2. Show criteria and models in advance.

Assess before teaching.  Pretests are a popular component of digital curricula but can \nbe implemented with a variety of digital resources by any teacher. Pre- assessments help \nteachers understand the knowledge and skills students already possess and can save \nthem time when data indicates learning outcomes students have already mastered.  \n4. Offer appropriate choices.  Digital resources expand the choices students have for \ndemonstrating their learning.  \n5. Provide feedback early and often.

Only self -reported grades (a formative strategy related to progress monitoring), \nPiagetian programs (using developmental theories from noted education expert Jean Piaget), \nand response to intervention have higher effect sizes.  \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, while technology is now often used in long- cycle, summative assessments, the \nauthors for the National Research Council (2012) acknowledge that there is widescale evidence \nthat long- cycle assessments, such as standardized tests,  do not adequately represent true \nmeasures of student progress towards learning goals, particularly because of the constraints of \nlimited time and testing formats (National Research Council, 2012). In other words, even \nsuccessful performance on long- cycle assessments may not indicate learning transfer, or may \nnot give students the opportunity to truly demonstrate transfer because they cannot assess \nstudents at the depth of rigor required by some content standards, standards at what may be \nclassified as the strategic thinking (DOK 3) or extended thinking Depth of Knowledge (DOK) \n47 levels (Webb, 1997). Instead, standards at this depth of rigor must be assessed in classrooms. \nIn order to provide learning opportunities that support transfer these authors list the following \nresearch -based methods for designing learning that yields transfer of knowledge:  \n \n\u2022 Use multiple and varied representations of concepts and tasks.

This is similar to Vygotsky\u2019s famous premise of the Zone of Proximal \nDevelopment (ZPD). Feedback that scaffolds learning and helps students progress \nacross the ZPD must be specific in nature. Simply indicating a learner response is \ncorrect or not, referred to as outcome  or performance feedback , has little to no \nvalue in terms of learning for transfer.

Identifying the concept of promoting a growth mindset promoted by \nDweck (2007) demonstrates that learners reach deeper learning associated with \ntransfer when they: (1) attribute thei r performance to effort rather than ability, (2)  \norient their goals towards mastering the material rather than performing well (or not), \n(3) believe they can be and expect to be successful, (4) believe that intelligence is \nchangeable, not fixed, and (5) a re interested in what they are learning.  \n                                                \n1 Originally developed by researchers at the Center for Applied Special Technologies (CAST) (Rose & Meyer, \n2002) and using the findings from neuroscience and insights on how people learn, the Universal Design for \nLearning Framework includes guidelines for e ducators that remove barriers to learning for all children. Now \nincluded in education policy, such as the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) and the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act (ESSA), UDL principles rely on digital technologies to provid e multiple means of \nengagement, representation, and action & expression. The guidelines can be found online at \nhttp://udlguidelines.cast.org/ .  48 \u2022 Use formative assessment strategies. The NRC reinforces findings from other \nresearchers that transfer can occur as a result of learning when formative \nassessment strategies are used to (1) make learning goals clear to learners, (2) \nmonitor learner progress, provide cognitive feedback, and help learners understand \nwhere they are in a learning progression, and (3) involve learners in self - and peer -\nassessment. These three characteristics are the acknowledge components of self -\ndirected learners (Ertmer & Newby, 1996).  \n \nMany educators believe that interim assessments, also referred to as benchmark assessments \nor tests, hold great promise to improve student achievement on summative assessments.

The \ntheory is that teachers and others that support learning will receive data on student progress \nduring the learning process so that instruction and learning opportunities can be modified based \non the medium -cycle assessment data. The key to their success is implementation. For int erim \nassessments to have the desired positive impact on student achievement as they are intended, \nthey must quickly and easily provide clear data within the learning cycle that teachers can act \nupon in a timely fashion. Interim assessments that are implemented more like their summative \ncounterparts opportunities for learning will not have the desired impact on student achievement \n(Christman, Neild, Bulkley, Blanc, Liu, Mitchell, & Travers, 2009; Goertz, Ol\u00e1h, & Riggan, 2009; \nKonstantopoulosa, Miller, van der Ploeg, & Lia, 2016).   \n \nFor interim assessments to have a greater impact on promoting positive student outcomes, \nadvocates suggest a wider conception of how they should be implemented, including using \nmultiple formats and methods. They should also be embedded in a culture where assessments \nare not seen as \u201ca test,\u201d but as an \nopportunity to monitor learning and change \nthe course for learners who need it. Critical \nto this culture, according to one large- scale \nstudy (Christman et al., 2009) are \u201clearning \nleaders\u201d who can engage all faculty in \nsubstantive conversations around teaching, \nassessment strategies, and the use of \nassessment data for more formative \napproaches. Effective learning leaders can \nfacilitate conversations in a supportive \nenvironment so teachers can consider how \ntheir specific students might learn best, \nwhat current instruction and resource have \nand have not worked, and to identify their own needs either for different methods, resources, or \neven to learn more about their content. These can be challenging conversations. As these \nresearchers noted, \u201cThe most important message from this research is that the success of even \na well -designed system of interim assessments is dependent on the knowledge and skills of the \nschool leaders and teachers who are responsible for bringing the system to life in",

Most assessment experts agree that interim \nassessments can be used for one of three different purposes, which determines when they are \nadministered; what resources are used to administer them; and how the data is collected, \nreported, and analyzed. When used for instructional purposes,  interim assessments are used \nmore like formative strategies during instruction to help adjust instruction, as necessary. Interim \nassessments that are used for evaluative purposes  occur less of ten and their data is often used \nover the span of years to make programmatic decisions about teaching practices, curricula, and \nother resources. Many school districts incorporate interim assessments for predictive purposes  \nto determine how well students wi ll perform on long- cycle summative assessments. Few, \nperhaps no, assessment experts agree that a valid and reliable assessment \u2014of any type\u2014can \nbe used for multiple purposes. The best assessments are designed to generate data for specific \ntypes of purposes and decision making (Perie, Marion, Gong & Wurtzel, 2007). Trying to use \nassessments for multiple purposes, especially purposes that they were not designed for, can \nerode their validity and reliability.  \n \n \n \nDistricts and schools that wish to use interim assessments for instructional purposes may want \nto expand their conception of what can be assessed and how, such as incorporating problems, \nprojects, and performances that generate a wide range of data to monitor student progress. In a \npolicy brief for the  Aspen Institute (Perie et al., 2007), the following eight characteristics are \nlisted for implementing interim assessments for instructional purposes:  \n \n1.

The assessment can be formative in nature and allow for practice, feedback, and second \nchances to solve a problem being addressed.  \n6. Because the assessment is complex, the scoring criteria can also be complex, \nsometimes requiring multiple indicators, portfolios, or other  means to score student work. \n(Frey, Schmitt, & Allen, 2012; Wiggins, 1998)  \n \n51  What does this principle mean for schools? \n\u2022 A variety of digital tools and resources are available to support a balanced approach to \nassessment that includes formative, interim, and summative assessment opportunities. \nThese tools can make it easier to present assessment items, sometimes score items, and to \ncollect, analyze, and report data from some of those assessments.

Determining assessments first can also \ndetermine the types of resources, such as digital technologies, and supporting skills that should also be addressed during instruction. \n\u2022 Formative assessment strategies are one of the most effective instructional interventions \nfor promoting student achievement.  \n\u2022 While standardized assessments can incorporate technology to capture and report student performance data, these assessments are limited by time and testing formats when trying to assess content standards that require strategic or extended thinking. \nThese standards are often assessed at the classroom level and require multiple and varied representations of concepts and tasks.  \n\u2022 Interim assessments can be used to impact student outcomes on later summative assessments if they are implemented with fidelity. In addition to embedding them within \nthe learning cycle and the reporting student data from these assessments, teachers and \nadministrators must be prepared to act upon that data to address student learning \nneeds. When used to provide opportunities for problem, project - or performance -based \nassessments, interim assessments may help teachers restructure teaching in the moment and provide a more comprehensive picture of student achievement.

Black & Wiliam (1998) reported in their seminal research synthesis \nthat not only were learning gains from formative assessment strategies among the largest reported for educational interventions, the largest student gains were made by those f ormerly \ncategorized as low achievers. As with other forms of assessment, the data generated when incorporating formative assessment strategies is more efficiently and effectively gathered when using digital tools.  \n \n \n There is some confusion around the term. Some educators and policymakers use the term \n\u201cformative assessment\u201d as an event, like a test, that is intended to help inform instruction but \ncan often take place long after instruction has occurred and so has minimal impact on day -to-\nday instruction. In this review, this type of assessment event is referred to as an interim assessment.  \n \nInstead, this review refers to formative assessment strategies,  not an event, which is in line \nwith the definition presented by the major researchers and their findings  cited above. Formative \nassessment strategies occur daily during the interactions students have with teachers, with each other, and in self -assessing their own learning. Formative assessment strategies may also \nbe referred to as assessments for  learning, because they are embedded in the learning process \n53 and should result in new learning by students. Because formative assessment strategies are a \npart of the learning process, they are not graded (Heritage, 2010; Wiliam, 2014). They can be \ninformal interactions, such as a series of probing questions a teacher asks a student or group of \nstudents during instruction, or a quick exit poll students respond to on their phones or laptops as \nthey leave class.

In all cases, \nformative assessment strategies represent a process, not an event (Alonzo, 2018; Furtak, \nMorrison & Kroog, 2014; Gotwals, 2018; Heritage, 2010; Linquanti, 2014; Wiliam, 2014).  \n \nFormative assessment strategies, according to Heritage (2010), are \u201caligned to the short -term \nsub-goals, which are the focus of the lesson, and data from them provide teachers with a steady \nstream of information to keep learning moving forward\u201d (p. 28). Teachers who implement \nformative assessment strategies effectively rely on known and evolving understandings of \nlearning progressions, both at a macro and very micro level. These micro learning progressions, \nas described ear lier, may be based on the best -known progression students are likely to make \nwhile mastering the learning outcomes for a lesson or unit but can be influenced by their prior \nknowledge, misconceptions, and skills. These effective teachers modify or update their \nunderstanding of micro learning progressions over time as they interact with their students.  \n \nOne common metaphor for describing progressions is that of using a map. On the map, the \nteacher and students need to know where they are and where they want to end up. But students \nin a single class may be at different \nstarting places and may take different \nroutes to get to the final destination \n(learning transfer).

The DOK framework not only \ndescribes the knowledge and academic skills students must master in a content area but also \nhow content knowledge and skills are used strategically when addressing real -world problems \nand to extend one\u2019s own knowledge through reflection and metacognition. Various digital \ntechnologies provide ample resources to help both students and teachers monitor and \n54 document learning progress efficiently and effectively, especially when students are in different \nplaces and take different routes to learning transfer. Examples follow:  \n \n1. DOK 1 .

At this depth of knowledge, students reflect on their performance in ill -structured, \nreal-world problems to deter mine what they have learned, what misunderstandings they \nmight have clarified, what learning strategies worked well, and how they might approach \nsimilar learning in the future. Sometimes referred to as \u201cmaking thinking visible\u201d \n(Ritchhart, Church & Morrison, 2011), many digital technologies can help students in \nthese metacognitive activities through the generation of concept maps, flowcharts, and \nreflections using text, imagery, video, or other media.  \n \nContinuing with the map idea, the formative assessment process is usually organized around a \nseries of three or four questions (Hattie, 2012; Heritage, 2010). When you think about traveling \nwith a map, these questions are often presented similar to the fol lowing:  \n \n1. Where am I going? \n2. Where am I now?  \n3. Where do I go next?  \n4. How will I get there?  \n \nIn terms of knowing where students ultimately need to end up, teachers use learning \nprogressions to determine the learning outcomes, often referred to as learning targets . Hattie \nrefers to them as \u201clearning intentions.\u201d Usually based on content standards, but sometimes \nincluding affective, behavioral, or social -emotional outcomes, students should understand what \nthe desired learning targets are in language that makes sense to them. If teachers cannot \ncreate clear learning targets that students understand, it is unlikely they can create valid and \nreliable assessment opportunities for students (Hattie, 2012).

Students and teachers should be able to determine whether \nstudents have met the success criteria or whether they\u2019re still on the road.  \n \nIn order for students to understand where \nthey are and where to go next, formative \nassessment strategies incorporate explicit \nfeedback based on student performance. \nThere is evidence that providing \nappropriate feedback to advance student \nunderstanding may be the most difficult \nstep in the formative assessment process \n(Alonzo, 2018). Finding out your answer \nwas correct or not (right or wrong), called \nperformance or outcome feedback,  does \nnot meet this type of explicit feedback \nnecessary for students to move forward \n(Butler & Winne, 1995). This is one reason \nearly programmed instruction held little \neducational value. While it may have been \nfun to try and beat your score of the \nnumber of questions correct, or sometimes to experience the raucous sounds and visuals for \nincorrect answers, simply knowing the status of your response gave students no direction of \nwhat to do next if they were correct, or what to try differently or not. Feedback that gets to this \nlevel of detail, sometimes referred to as cognitive feedback  (Butler & Winne, 1995), helps \nstudents measure their current understanding (where they are), and what they might do to \nimprove their performance or to move towards the final learning target (where to do next).  \n \nThe final question, \u2018How will I get there?\u2019 often depends on the teacher\u2019s content and \npedagogical knowledge, but sometimes can be sca ffolded by adaptive curricula (or intelligent \ntutoring systems), rubrics, scoring guidelines, or other curricula material.

Technology proficiency, often embodied by New Literacies, is \nnecessary to make the most of technology resources. Both teachers and students require \ntechnology proficiency, but those proficiencies change over time. This does not suggest an \nemphasi s on basic technology skills. Mastering New Literacies requires developing skills in \ncontext, and continued opportunities to enhance those skills as technologies change. Having \nteachers and students participate in decontextualized, low -level programs that teach basic \ntechnology skills that may soon be outdated is not the answer. Instead, having teachers and \n58 students develop the skills to become self -directed, independent learners will allow them to \nintegrate and use technology more effectively and to incorporate relevant new and emerging \ntechnologies as they become available.  \n \nReaching a point where teachers and students are self -directed, independent learners who \nleverage technologies to support teaching and learning takes time and support. Yes, the \ntangibl e supports of hardware, networking, and content resources are important, but teachers \nand students also require sufficient time to develop and hone their skills, to monitor what is and \nisn\u2019t working, and to explore new technologies and digital resources. T hey need time to practice, \nand sometimes fail, and learn from those experiences so they are better adept at meeting the \nnext challenge.  \n \nThe suggestion that things can go wrong, that failure is an opportunity for learning, suggests \nthat schools that do not  already embody this philosophy may need more substantial supports for \nchanging the culture of the school, or the mindset of those in the school. Changing the culture of \nschooling can be daunting, as it calls all stakeholders to question their own roles and the \npurposes of the organization. But schools the retain the mindset that \u201cstandards -based\u201d \ninstruction means providing shallow learning opportunities that result in dependent learners \nthrough the use of low -level \u201cread and complete\u201d worksheets or drill -and-",

Nor will they reach the potential of technology to truly support \nthe generation of self -directed, independent learners who can transfer their learning to authentic \nsettings. Those schools that empower teachers and learners to take risks and to learn from their \nmistakes are those where technology has the greatest potential for promoting desired student \noutcomes \u2014whether academic, behavioral, or social -emotional. Schools that help teachers \nbecome those that leverage technologies for authentic learning opportunities will see a higher \nreturn on their technology investments as yielded through increased student learning.  \n \n  59  References  \n \nBradshaw, A.

These efforts interact with the expanding use of technology, which affects the lives of students both inside and outside of the classroom. Thus, the role that technology plays in education is an evolving area of research that continues to grow in importance. While access to technology can provide valuable learning opportunities to students, it does not guarantee successful outcomes. Designing successful practices for student use of technology is but one piece of the puzzle in the continued effort to elevate the educational experiences of all students. Schools, teachers, communities, and families play a critical role in successfully integrating technology into teaching, learning, and assessment.\nRecent legislation acknowledges the growing role that \ntechnology plays in students\u2019 daily lives. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides guidance to state governments on how to receive supplemental federal funding for public education.

The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides guidance to state governments on how to receive supplemental federal funding for public education. As part of the ESSA legislation, the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) is required to produce a report on the educational impact of access to digital learning resources (DLR) outside of the classroom. Specifically, ESSA requests that IES conduct the following research:\n1. An analysis of student habits related to DLR \noutside of the classroom, including the location and types of devices and technologies that students use for educational purposes;\n2. An identification of the barriers students face in accessing DLR outside of the classroom;\n3. A description of the challenges that students who lack home internet access face, including challenges related to student participation and engagement in the classroom and homework completion;\n4. An analysis of how the barriers and challenges such students face impact the instructional practices of educators; and\n5. A description of the ways in which state education agencies, local education agencies, schools, and other entities, including partnerships of such entities, have developed effective means to address the barriers and challenges students face in accessing DLR outside of the classroom.This report, produced by the IES\u2019 National Center for \nEducation Statistics (NCES), responds to the ESSA mandate for an analysis of the educational impact of access to DLR outside of the classroom.\nDigital Learning Resources \nAs defined in ESSA (2015), the term \u201cdigital learning\u201d refers to \u201cany instructional practice that effectively uses technology to strengthen a student\u2019s learning experience and encompasses a wide spectrum of tools and practices\u201d (p. 1969). This includes: \n(a) interactive learning resources, digital learning content (which may include openly licensed content), software, or simulations, that engage students in academic content; (b) access to online databases and other primary source documents; (c) the use of data and information to personalize learning and provide targeted supplementary instruction; (d)\u00a0 online and computer-based assessments; (e) learning environments that allow for rich collaboration and communication, which may include student collaboration with content experts and peers; (f)\u00a0hybrid or blended learning, which occurs under direct instructor supervision at a school or other location away from home and, at least in part, through online delivery of instruction with some element of student control over time, place",

(p. 1969)\nAs described above, a variety of technological tools and practices can fall under the category of \u201cdigital learning resources.\u201d For the purpose of this report, DLR refers to computers (i.e., laptops, desktops, and notebooks), mobile devices (i.e., smart phones and tablets), and broadband internet.\n1 This report assumes that students \nprimarily engage in digital learning through these resources. \n1 In 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \ndefined \u201cbroadband\u201d as internet access with speeds of 4\u00a0Mbps \nfor downloads and 1\u00a0Mbps for uploads (FCC 2015). Over time, the number of users per household increased, and subsequently in 2015 the FCC changed the definition of broadband to speeds of at least 25 Mbps for downloads and 3\u00a0Mbps for uploads. The terms \u201cbroadband\u201d and \u201chigh-speed\u201d are used interchangeably in this report.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    xiiReport Overview and Methods\nThis report draws upon the most recently available \nnationally representative data sources, existing research, \nand relevant state and local intervention efforts to \nexamine the five research areas identified in ESSA, and to provide an overview of student access to DLR \noutside of the classroom. To address research areas 1 \nand 2, nationally and internationally representative \nsurvey data collected by NCES, the Census Bureau, \nand other organizations are analyzed in the form of brief indicators describing student access to DLR outside \nof the classroom. The statistical sources for the report \ngenerally consist of surveys with the most recent data (i.e., from 2015), due to the rapidly changing nature \nof DLR. \nStudent Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of \nthe Classroom  focuses primarily on children between \nthe ages of 3 and 18.

Due to \ndifferences in the survey populations and the indicator \ntopics of interest, the report indicators reference either \nchildren in a specific age range or students in a specific \nage range or grade level. Each indicator specifies which population is being discussed in its text and figures.\nThe summary of existing research and relevant state \nand local intervention efforts described in this report \naddress topics for which limited or no recent nationally \nrepresentative statistical data sources are available (i.e., research areas 3, 4 and 5). For research area 3, a summary \nof existing research, combined with a set of indicators \ndrawing data from national and international surveys, describes the challenges faced by students who lack \nhome access to the Internet and DLR. The summary of \nexisting research is limited to empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals and government reports from \n2005 to 2016, so as to best describe the current state of \nDLR access outside of the classroom. The state and local \nintervention efforts cited in this report focus on those \nconducted in 2015 and 2016 (2015 being the most recent data year reported in the indicators and 2016 being the \nyear before the report was in production). \nThe sections of this report are aligned to the research \nareas identified in the ESSA legislation.

The percentages of children \nwith computer and internet access at home in 2015 \nwere higher for children who were older, those whose \nparents had higher levels of educational attainment, and those whose families had higher incomes. Also, higher percentages of children who were White (66\u00a0percent), Asian (63 \u00a0percent), and of Two or more \nraces (64\u00a0percent) had home internet access in 2015 \nthan did Black (53\u00a0percent), Hispanic (52\u00a0percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native children (49 percent).\nLocation and Means of Internet Access \nFor those children who had access to the Internet in 2015, the two locations with the highest reported levels of internet access were at home (86 percent) and \nat school (65 percent), and the two most common \nmeans of internet access at home were a high-speed internet service and a mobile internet service or data plan ( Indicators\u00a03\u00a0 and 4). In 2015, about 78 percent \nof children ages 3 to 18 who used the Internet at home accessed it through a high-speed internet service \ninstalled at home; this percentage was lower than the \ncorresponding percentage in 2010 (89 percent). In contrast, a higher percentage of children who used the Internet at home accessed it through a mobile internet service or data plan in 2015 (67 percent) than in 2010 \n(9 percent).\nComputer Use at Home and for Schoolwork \nIn 2015, about 88 percent of 8th-graders and 83\u00a0percent \nof 4th-graders reported that they used a computer at home, and 80 percent of 8th-graders reported using a computer for schoolwork on a weekday ( Indicators 5 \u00a0 and \n6).

The percentages of \nhouseholds with computer and internet access varied by \nstate. For example, in 2015 the percentage of households with computer access ranged from 79 percent in Mississippi to 93 percent in Utah, and the percentage of households with internet access ranged from 62 percent in Mississippi to 85 percent each in New Hampshire and \nWashington ( Indicator 7 ). When comparing the United \nStates with other countries, the United States had higher \npercentages of students with computer and internet access at home in 2015 than the average of countries participating in the Trends in International Mathematics \nand Science Study ( Indicator 8 ). Also, in 2012 the United \nStates had a higher percentage of 16- to 19-year-olds \nusing spreadsheet or word processing software every day than the average of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (Indicator 9 ).\nBarriers in Student Access to Digital Learning \nResources Outside of the Classroom\nSection 2 presents five indicators that provide an \noverview of potential barriers to students\u2019 access to the Internet and computers at home. In 2015, the two main \nreasons children ages 3 to 18 lacked access to the Internet \nat home were that access was too expensive and that their family did not need it or was not interested in having it (38 percent each; Indicator 10 ). Internet access being \ntoo expensive was more commonly the main barrier for children from low-income families and for children \nwhose parents had low levels of educational attainment \nthan for other children. \nStudent Internet Access by Locale, Race/Ethnicity,  \nand Poverty \nIn addition, 5- to 17-year-old students\u2019 access to fixed broadband service\n2 at home differed by geographic locale \n(Indicators 11  and 12 ).

For example, the percentage of students in remote rural (65 percent) \n2 Fixed broadband (of any sort) excludes mobile broadband, but \nincludes all other non-dial-up internet service, such as DSL, \ncable modem, fiber-optic cable, and satellite internet service.and distant rural areas (66 percent) with fixed broadband \naccess was lower than in other locales, with percentages ranging from 70 percent in distant towns to 85 percent \nin large suburbs. In contrast, the percentage of students \nwith either no internet access or only dial-up access at home was higher for those living in remote rural areas (18\u00a0percent) than for those living in all other detailed locale types, with the percentages ranging from 7 percent in large suburbs to 16 percent in distant rural areas. \nWithin locale types, there were additional gaps \namong students of different poverty levels and racial/\nethnic groups. For example, in remote rural areas the percentages of students who had either no internet access or only dial-up access at home were higher for Black (41\u00a0percent) and Hispanic students (26 percent) than \nfor White (13\u00a0percent) and Asian students (11 percent). \nThis section also shows that a lower percentage of \nstudents eligible for free or reduced-price lunch reported that they had a digital device in their home, or that they first used a computer prior to first grade, than their peers who were not eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (Indicators\u00a013 and 14).\nChallenges Faced by Students Who Lack Access to \nDigital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom\nSection 3 presents both a summary of prior research \nand eight indicators that explore the challenges faced by students who lack access to DLR outside of the \nclassroom.

There is less research on relationships between \nstudents\u2019 access to DLR at home and their participation and engagement in the classroom than on other topics more narrowly focused on classroom activities. However, some studies explored relationships between student computer access at home and academic outcomes, with \nmixed findings. While some studies of home computer \naccess revealed positive correlations with academic performance (Jackson et al. 2006; Beltran, Das, and Fairlie 2010; Espinosa et al. 2006; Fish et al. 2008), others found no relationship or negative relationships \nbetween home computer access and student achievement \n(Fairlie and Robinson 2013; Hunley et al. 2005; Vigdor, Ladd, and Martinez 2014). In addition, research on the impact of instructional computer use in schools on academic performance, including some randomized control trials and several quasi-experimental studies, \nfound mixed results (Campuzano et al. 2009; Dynarski \net al. 2007; Goolsbee and Guryan 2006; Shannon et al. 2015; Suhr et al. 2010; Chambers et al. 2011).Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    xivThe indicators in Section 3 show higher average \nachievement scores for students who used computers at home and/or had internet access at home than for \nthose who did not ( Indicators 15\u201321 ). However, these \nanalyses do not systematically take into account multiple \nsocioeconomic background characteristics that are known to affect student achievement.

Associations between socioeconomic characteristics and DLR access are presented in Section 1 of this report. For example, in \n2015 the average National Assessment of Educational \nProgress (NAEP) reading scale score was higher for 8th-grade students who used a computer at home (268) than for those who did not use a computer at home (247). Similarly, the average reading scale score was higher for 8th-grade students who had access to the Internet at \nhome (267) than for those who did not have access to the \nInternet at home (242). The size of the achievement gaps between those who reported using a computer at home/having access to the Internet at home and those who did not varied by student and family characteristics. For an \ninternational reference point, Indicator 22  shows that a \nhigher percentage of U.S. 16- to 19-year-olds performed \nat the lowest proficiency level in problem solving in technology-rich environments than the OECD average. \nImpact of Access to Digital Learning Resources \nOutside of the Classroom on Instructional Practices \nof Educators\nSection 4 presents a summary of prior research. Student \naccess to DLR outside of the classroom may impact the \ninstructional practices of educators. However, based on \nthe results of the literature search of empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals and government \nreports from 2005 to 2016, existing research on potential \nimpacts is lacking. Thus, the included studies and \ntheir results may not be representative. The handful \nof relevant studies present limited evidence regarding the relationship between teachers\u2019 knowledge of \nstudent access to and experience with DLR outside the \nclassroom and instructional practices. For example, a \nstudy conducted with 36 elementary and secondary \nschool teachers who created course websites found \nthat contextual barriers, including teacher perceptions \nthat students could not access the Internet from home, \nresulted in the majority of teachers not using such \nwebsites on a regular basis (Friedman 2006). \nOther research found that teachers tended to ",

    "text": " perceptions \nthat students could not access the Internet from home, \nresulted in the majority of teachers not using such \nwebsites on a regular basis (Friedman 2006). \nOther research found that teachers tended to \nunderestimate student access to DLR outside of the \nclassroom because the teachers tended to focus primarily \non access to computers and did not take into account \nstudent experience with other digital technologies, such as video game consoles (Henderson 2011; Honan 2008). \nBased on these perceptions, the author concluded that \nteachers tended to focus their lessons on familiarizing students with operating computers (Honan 2008). \nAs student access to DLR outside of the classroom \nincreases over time, educators may need to adapt instructional practices in an effort to incorporate home-based technology into teaching and learning. A larger body of research is available on the challenges \nand barriers teachers and schools face in adapting \ninstructional practices to further develop students\u2019 digital literacy skills for use of DLR both inside and outside of the classroom. Reviews of prior research suggest that individual, school, and technical factors are associated with teachers\u2019 use of information and communication \ntechnology in the classroom (Buabeng-Andoh 2012; Fu \n2013). Conclusions from the literature review suggest that at the individual level, teachers are less likely to use technology in the classroom if they lack the confidence, skills, and pedagogical training to do so; if they do not \nperceive a benefit of using a new technology over current \ninstructional approaches; or if they anticipate the new approach will be difficult or time-intensive to adopt. At the school level, technology experiences may be limited by organizational structures, such as an emphasis on traditional assessment and instructional methods or on \nrestrictive curricula. Technical-level barriers include the \nabsence of current and well-maintained hardware or appropriate instructional software, and limited access to technology resources in the school.

Section \n5 describes a few examples of such interventions being \nconducted in 2015 and 2016 (2015 being the most recent data collection year reported and 2016 being the year before the report was in production). Organizations such as EducationSuperHighway, the State Educational Technology Directors Association, and other local-level \ninitiatives help bring DLR access to students and their \nfamilies both inside and outside of the classroom at lower costs. Lowering the family cost for internet access could mitigate some of the cost barriers identified in Section\u00a02. For example, some districts are installing \nwireless routers on buses or providing mobile Wi-Fi \nhotspots so that students can access the Internet outside of the classroom. Other local-level strategies to increase student internet access to DLR outside the classroom include providing funding for internet access programs and providing devices directly to students to help bridge \nthe digital divide.\nSummary\nThe findings from this report highlight the generally \nwide home-based access to the Internet for the nation\u2019s children. However, gaps in internet access do remain \nbetween different groups of children. In particular, 5- to \n17-year-old students living below the poverty threshold have lower rates of home internet access than students living between 100 and 185 percent of the poverty threshold and students living at greater than 185 percent of the poverty threshold. Also, American Indian/Alaska \nNative, Black, and Hispanic students have lower rates \nof home internet access than their peers who are White, Asian, and of Two or more races. \nThe geographic locale in which a student\u2019s home is \nsituated also plays an important role in home-based internet access. Students living in households in remote \nrural and distant rural areas generally had more limited \naccess to the Internet than students in suburbs, cities, or towns, with the exception of remote towns. For 5- to 17-year-old students living in households in remote rural areas, the percentage without internet access at home was particularly high. For instance, in remote rural \nareas 41 percent of Black students and 35 percent of \nstudents living in poverty had either no internet access or only had dial-up access at home.

For instance, in remote rural \nareas 41 percent of Black students and 35 percent of \nstudents living in poverty had either no internet access or only had dial-up access at home. Students without home internet access had lower assessment scores in reading, mathematics, and science across a range of national and international assessments. International \ncomparisons against advanced countries showed that \nthe United States had a higher-than-average percentage of 16- to 19-year-olds with the lowest level of computer literacy skills.\nFuture Directions\nThe purpose of this report is to present findings regarding student habits with DLR, the challenges and barriers faced by students who lack access to DLR \noutside of the classroom, how these challenges and \nbarriers impact both students and teachers and their instructional practices, and what steps have been taken by state and local entities to address these challenges and barriers. The research for this report highlighted some areas that could benefit from additional attention \nor enhanced data collections:\n\u2022 Purpose of DLR: Data on how many students \nhave access to DLR and what types of students \ntend to have access, both inside and outside of the classroom, are readily available. However, prior research has shown that having access to DLR does not uniformly improve students\u2019 learning \nexperiences. As such, the field would benefit from \nmore knowledge of how students use different types of DLR both inside and outside of the classroom, with a particular focus on how they are used for educational purposes. \n\u2022 Impact on Students: More studies could \nexplore how students\u2019 access to DLR outside \nof the classroom impacts their participation, \nengagement, and achievement inside the classroom. Additional data could also be \ncollected on the frequency and nature of DLR \nuse outside of the classroom and its relationship \nto academic outcomes, since some prior research \nshows that moderate internet use was associated with higher academic scores than frequent or \nrare internet use.\n\u2022 Impact on Teachers: Student access to DLR \noutside of the classroom may impact the \ninstructional practices of educators. However, existing research on potential relationships is limited. A larger body of research is available on the challenges and barriers teachers and \nschools face in adapting instructional practices to Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom    ",

The available research on teachers\u2019 perceptions of disparities in student and parent internet access at home suggests that these perceptions may impact their instructional decisions, but more \nresearch is needed in this area. \nValuable studies of these relationships could be \nconducted at the local, state, or national level. The \neducation research community could play an important role in improving our understanding of the interactions of home and school use of the Internet, and assisting in the development of effective instructional practices. \nEducation researchers could also take steps to improve \nthe potential for more detailed research on the use of technology. For example, longitudinal studies could be designed to collect nationally representative data about students, parents, teachers, and schools. Future longitudinal studies could collect information from \nparents about home internet use that could then \nbe examined in terms of their potential relation to academic outcomes. National and state longitudinal studies frequently include socioeconomic variables that also would be key components of effective analyses of \npotential relationships between the use of DLR and \neducational outcomes, with respect to equity. The availability of assessment points at multiple intervals could enable researchers to examine both change over time in access to DLR, as well as the interaction that these changes may have with educational outcomes. \nFurther research will also need to be sensitive to the \nongoing concerns about internet safety and security, as well as the appropriate scope of digital activities for children. \nThis report addresses questions related to the scope of \ntechnology use at home and provides some information on the relationship between technology and student outcomes. However, answering questions related to how technology is used for education purposes outside \nof school and for what purposes remains challenging, \nand is thus an important area for continued research.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    xviiReader\u2019s Guide\nStudent Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of \nthe Classroom draws upon relevant data sources, existing research, and relevant state and local intervention \nefforts to examine the five research areas",

When a sample survey is used, statistical uncertainty is introduced, because the data come from only a portion of the entire population. This statistical uncertainty must be considered when \nreporting estimates and making comparisons. For more \ninformation, please see the section on standard errors below.\nVarious types of statistics derived from sample surveys \nare presented in this report. Many indicators report the size of a population or a subpopulation, and often the size of a subpopulation is expressed as a percentage of \nthe total population. In addition, the average (or\u00a0 mean ) \nvalue of some characteristic of the population or \nsubpopulation may be reported. The average is obtained by summing the values for all members of the population and dividing the sum by the size of the population. \nThe summary of existing research is limited to \nempirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals \nand government reports from 2005 to 2016, so as to best describe the current state of DLR access outside of the classroom. Relevant journal articles and reports published during this period were located by searching online databases and checking reference \nlists. The databases used included Education Resources \nInformation Center (ERIC), Education Research Complete via EBSCO, and Google Scholar.

It is important to understand that these examples are not \nrepresentative of all the types of efforts that are currently \nbeing made. It is likely that there are other examples of state and local initiatives that are not discussed here because reports were not produced about these efforts within the time frame that we used for our search procedures.\nStandard Errors \nUsing estimates calculated from data based on a sample \nof the population requires consideration of several factors \nbefore the estimates become meaningful. When using \ndata from a sample, some margin of error  will always \nbe present in estimations of characteristics of the total population or subpopulation because the data are \navailable from only a portion of the total population. \nConsequently, data from samples can provide only an \napproximation of the true or actual value. The margin \nof error of an estimate, or the range of potential true \nor actual values, depends on several factors such as \nthe amount of variation in the responses, the size and representativeness of the sample, and the size of the \nsubgroup for which the estimate is computed. The \nmagnitude of this margin of error is measured by what \nstatisticians call the \u201cstandard error\u201d of an estimate. \nLarger standard errors typically mean that the estimate \nis less accurate, while smaller standard errors typically \nindicate that the estimate is more accurate.\nWhen data from sample surveys are reported, the \nstandard error is calculated for each estimate. The \nstandard errors for all estimated totals, means, medians, \nor percentages are reported in the reference tables. \nIn order to caution the reader when interpreting findings \nin the indicators, estimates from sample surveys are flagged with a \u201c!\u201d when the standard error is between 30\u00a0 and 50\u00a0 percent of",

Although one estimate may appear to be larger than another, a statistical test may find that the \napparent difference between them is not measurable due \nto the uncertainty around the estimates. In this case, the estimates will be described as having no measurable \ndifference , meaning that the difference between them is \nnot statistically significant.\nWhether differences in means or percentages are \nstatistically significant can be determined using the \nstandard errors of the estimates. In the indicators in \nthis report and other reports produced by NCES, when differences are statistically significant, the probability that the difference occurred by chance is less than 5\u00a0percent, according to NCES standards.\nFor all indicators that report estimates based on samples, \ndifferences between estimates (including increases and \ndecreases) are stated only when they are statistically significant. To determine whether differences reported are statistically significant, two-tailed t tests at the \n.05\u00a0level are typically used. The t test formula for \ndetermining statistical significance is adjusted when \nthe samples being compared are dependent. The t test \nformula is not adjusted for multiple comparisons, with \nthe exception of statistical tests conducted using the NAEP Data Explorer . When the variables to be tested \nare postulated to form a trend over time, the relationship \nmay be tested using linear regression or ANOVA trend \nanalyses instead of a series of t tests.

This report uses descriptive statistics to explore differences in students\u2019 access to and use of DLR at home by individual, family, and neighborhood characteristics, \nas well as associations between DLR access/use and \nacademic outcomes. One of the limitations of bivariate statistics is that they describe subpopulation differences without taking into account the influence of other individual, family, school, or environmental factors. Many of the variables examined in this report may be \nrelated to other factors outside of students\u2019 access to \nand use of computers and the Internet in their homes. Future research using more complex methods, such as Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    xixmultivariate analyses, can further explore variations in \nstudent access to and use of DLR; it can also examine relationships between access and academic outcomes \nafter taking into account other characteristics of \nstudents, families, and schools that are interrelated.

The OMB revised the guidelines on racial/ethnic categories used by the federal government in October 1997, with a January 2003 deadline for implementation. The revised standards require a minimum of these five categories for data on race: \nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or \nAfrican American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. The standards also require the \ncollection of data on ethnicity categories, at a minimum, \nHispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino. It is important to note that Hispanic origin is an ethnicity rather than a race, and therefore persons of Hispanic \norigin may be of any race. Origin can be viewed as the \nheritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person\u2019s parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States.

The poverty thresholds do not vary geographically and are adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index. The official \npoverty definition counts money income before taxes \nand does not include capital gains and noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps). \nFamily income includes all monetary income from all \nsources (including jobs, businesses, interest, rent, and Social Security payments) over a 12-month period. \nThe income of nonrelatives living in the household is \nexcluded, but the income of all family members age 15\u00a0or older (age 14 or older in years prior to 1989), including those temporarily living outside of the household, is included.\nLimitations of the Data \nThe relatively small sizes of the American Indian/Alaska Native and Pacific Islander populations pose many measurement difficulties when conducting statistical \nanalyses. Even in larger surveys, the numbers of American \nIndians/Alaska Natives and Pacific Islanders included in a sample are often small. Researchers studying data on these two populations often face small sample sizes that reduce the reliability of results. Survey data for American Indians/Alaska Natives often have somewhat \nhigher standard errors than data for other racial/ethnic \ngroups. Due to large standard errors, differences that seem substantial are often not statistically significant and, therefore, not cited in the text. \nData on American Indians/Alaska Natives are",

These efforts interact with the expanding use of technology, which affects the lives of students both inside and outside of the classroom. Thus, the role that technology plays in education is an evolving \narea of research that continues to grow in importance. While access to technology can provide valuable \nlearning opportunities to students, it does not guarantee successful outcomes. Designing successful practices for student use of technology is but one piece of the puzzle in the continued effort to elevate the educational experiences of all students. Schools, teachers, communities, and families play a critical role in successfully integrating technology into teaching, learning, and assessment.\nRecent legislation acknowledges the growing role that technology plays in students\u2019 daily lives. The Every \nStudent Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides guidance to state governments on how to receive supplemental \nfederal funding for public education. As part of the ESSA legislation, the Institute of Education Sciences \n(IES) is required to produce a report on the educational impact of access to digital learning resources (DLR) outside of the classroom. Specifically, ESSA requests that IES conduct the following research:\n1. An analysis of student habits related to DLR outside of the classroom, including the location and \ntypes of devices and technologies that students use for educational purposes;\n2. An identification of the barriers students face in accessing DLR outside of the classroom;\n3. A description of the challenges that students who lack home internet access face, including challenges related to student participation and engagement in the classroom, and homework completion;\n4. An analysis of how the barriers and challenges such students face impact the instructional practices of educators; and\n5. A description of the ways in which state education agencies, local education agencies, schools, and other entities, including partnerships of such entities, have developed effective means to address \nthe barriers and challenges students face in accessing DLR outside of the classroom.\nThis report, produced by IES\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), responds to the ESSA \nmandate for an analysis of the educational impact of access to DLR outside of the",

To address research areas \u00a01\u00a0and \n2, nationally and internationally representative survey data collected by NCES, the Census Bureau, and \nother organizations were analyzed in the form of brief indicators describing student access to DLR outside of the classroom. The statistical sources for the report generally consist of surveys with the most recent data (i.e., from 2015), due to the rapidly changing nature of DLR.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    2Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of \nthe Classroom  focuses primarily on children between \nthe ages of 3 and 18. Most indicators in the report \nsummarize data from sample surveys conducted by \nNCES or household surveys conducted by the Census Bureau such as the American Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS). Due to differences in the survey populations and the indicator topics of interest, the report indicators reference either \nchildren in a specific age range or students in a specific \nage range or grade level. Each indicator specifies which population is being discussed in its text and figures.\nThe summary of existing research and relevant state \nand local intervention efforts described in this report addresses topics for which limited or no recent nationally \nrepresentative statistical data sources are available (i.e., \nresearch areas 3, 4 and 5). For research area 3, a summary of existing research, combined with a set of indicators drawing data from national and international surveys, describes the challenges faced by students who lack home access to the Internet and DLR. The summary of \nexisting research focuses on empirical studies published \nin peer-reviewed journals since 2005 in order to describe recent patterns of DLR access outside of the classroom.

This includes:\n(a) interactive learning resources, digital learning \ncontent (which may include openly licensed \ncontent), software, or simulations, that engage \nstudents in academic content; (b) access to online databases and other primary source documents; \n(c) the use of data and information to personalize \nlearning and provide targeted supplementary instruction; (d)\u00a0online and computer-based \nassessments; (e) learning environments that allow \nfor rich collaboration and communication, which may include student collaboration with content experts and peers; (f) hybrid or blended learning, which occurs under direct instructor supervision at \na school or other location away from home and, at \nleast in part, through online delivery of instruction with some element of student control over time, \nplace, path, or pace; and (g) access to online course \nopportunities for students in rural or remote areas. \n(p. 1969)\nAs described above, a variety of technological tools and \npractices can fall under the category of \u201cdigital learning \nresources.\u201d For the purpose of this report, DLR refers to computers (i.e., laptops, desktops, and notebooks), mobile devices (i.e., smart phones and tablets), and broadband internet. This report assumes that students \nprimarily engage in digital learning through these \nresources and that they are most imperative to student learning experiences.\nIn 2010, the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) defined \u201cbroadband\u201d as internet access with speeds of 4\u00a0 Mbps for downloads and 1 Mbps for uploads (FCC 2015).

Over time, the number of users \nper household increased, and subsequently in 2015 the \nFCC changed the definition of broadband to speeds of at least 25\u00a0Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. The terms \u201cbroadband\u201d and \u201chigh-speed\u201d are used interchangeably in this report.\nFederal Policy Context\nA number of federal policies worked to increase the availability of DLR to students. For example, the FCC implemented the Schools and Libraries program \n(E-rate) in 1997 in an effort to make internet access and \ntelecommunications more affordable, and thus more accessible, to eligible schools and libraries (FCC\u00a02016b). While schools and libraries must still cover some of the costs of these DLR, E-rate provided substantial discounts that were commensurate with the needs of \nthe community, with high-poverty areas receiving \npriority funding. In addition to E-rate, in 2012 the FCC introduced the Connect America Fund, which increased home internet access by providing broadband network upgrades (FCC 2015). \nIn addition, the Enhancing Education Through \nTechnology program, which was part of the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, invested in technology and education reform (State Educational Technology Directors Association 2010). In 2013, the Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    3White House\u2019s ConnectED Initiative raised public \nand private contributions, with the goal of providing 99 percent of students with broadband internet access \nin their classrooms and libraries by 2018 (The White \nHouse, Office of the Press Secretary 2015). Other federal department- and agency-level programs included Community Connect by the Department of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2016), the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program of the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration, \nand ConnectHome by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These programs aimed to bring broadband access to rural communities, encourage the adoption of broadband internet at home, and help low-\nincome households obtain access at an affordable price \n(U.S. Department of Commerce n.d.; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban",

In 2014, the Office of Educational Technology provided examples of ways in which federal grant funding could be used to support teaching and learning with technology, including supporting professional development for educators, investing in DLR (e.g., \nsoftware, devices) for students, and using technology \nto increase communication and collaboration between educators and stakeholders (e.g., parents, STEM professionals) (Culatta 2014). The Partners in Education research by the Department of Education also \nemphasized the importance of supporting teachers by \nhighlighting the role of collaboration between parents and educators (Fox and Jones 2016).This page intentionally left blank.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    5Section 1: Student Use of Digital Learning \nResources Outside of the Classroom\nThis section presents nine indicators based on analyses of the most recently available nationally and \ninternationally representative survey data that provide an overview of student habits related to digital learning resources (DLR) outside of the classroom. The first six indicators describe the percentages of \nchildren in the United States who have access to and use computers and the Internet in their homes and \nother locations outside of school. Information is presented for children overall as well as by characteristics of children, their families, and their home locations. The final three indicators provide comparisons within the United States and at the international level regarding access to DLR outside of the classroom.\nAccess to and Use of Digital Learning Resources in the United States\nResults from the indicator analyses show that 94 percent of children ages 3 to 18 had a computer at home and 61 percent of children ages 3 to 18 used the Internet at home in 2015 ( Indicators 1  and 2 ).

The July supplement consists solely of questions about computer and internet use. In contrast, the October supplement focuses on school enrollment, although it also includes questions about computer and internet use. Measurable differences in estimates across years could reflect actual changes in the population; however, differences could also reflect seasonal variations in data collection or differences between the content of the July and October supplements. Therefore, caution should be used when making year-to-year comparisons. Percentages for means of internet access at home are only based on persons who use the Internet at home.2 The different types of internet access may sum to more than \n100 percent because a single home internet user can have more \nthan one type of access (e.g., high-speed internet service plus a mobile phone data plan).3 Respondents were asked whether they accessed the Internet at home using \u201csome other service.\u201d Examples of other service were not provided to respondents.\nReference tables: Table 4.1.This page intentionally left blank.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    30\nIndicator 5\nStudent Computer Use and Internet Access at Home\nIn 2015, some 88 percent of 8th-grade students reported that they used a computer at home, and \n92 percent reported that they had access to the Internet at home.

The percentage of households with computer access ranged from 79 percent in Mississippi to 93 percent in Utah. The percentage of households with internet access ranged from 62 percent in Mississippi to 85 percent each in New Hampshire and Washington.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau has asked questions in the \nC\nurrent Population Survey (CPS) about computer use \nsince 1984 and internet access since 1997. Starting in 2013, the Census Bureau began including questions about computer and internet access in the American Community Survey (ACS). While these historical estimates from the CPS are presented in other indicators included earlier in this section, the inclusion of computer and internet questions in the ACS provides estimates at more detailed levels of geography. This indicator is different from other indicators presented in this report as it focuses on all U.S. households and not households with children.  \nThis indicator uses the ACS to examine the percentage \nof U.S. households who own or use computers and the percentage of households with internet access by state. In 2015, about 87 percent of households owned or used a computer at home and 77 percent of households had internet access; however, household computer use and internet access varied across states. In this indicator, households with computer access include all households whose members own or use a desktop, laptop, netbook, or notebook computer; handheld computer, smart mobile phone, or other handheld wireless computer; or some other type of computer.

This section presents five indicators based on analyses of the most recently available nationally representative survey data that provide \nan overview of potential barriers to students\u2019 access to the Internet and computers at home. The section \nalso describes how access for children with different individual and household characteristics varies in ways that may be associated with these barriers.\nBarriers to Internet Access\nResults from the indicator analyses find that the two main reasons children ages 3 to 18 lacked access to the Internet at home in 2015 were that access was too expensive and that the family did not need it or was not interested in having it (38 percent each, Indicator 10 ).

Other main reasons for no home internet \naccess were that the home lacked an adequate computer for internet use, internet service was not available in the area, the Internet could be used elsewhere, and the family had concerns about online privacy, cybersecurity, and personal safety. Internet access being too expensive was more commonly the main barrier for children from low income families and for children whose parents had low levels of educational attainment than for other children. \nThe percentage of students ages 5 to 17 who had access to the Internet at home in 2015 varied by their \nhome\u2019s geographic locale and their family\u2019s poverty status ( Indicators 11  and\u00a012). Fixed broadband access 1 \nat home was most common for students in suburban areas and least common for students in rural areas. Also, fixed broadband access was less common in remote and distant rural areas than in fringe rural areas. Within these locale types, there were additional gaps among students of different poverty levels and racial/ethnic groups. Across geographic locales, the percentages of students with either no internet access or only dial-up access were consistently higher for students living below the poverty threshold than for students \nliving at greater than 185 percent of the poverty threshold.\nAlthough the data used for the indicators in this report were not able to explore barriers to home internet \naccess for people residing on Tribal lands 2 or in U.S. territories, the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) reports such information in its 2016 Broadband Progress Report  (FCC 2016a). At the end of 2014, \nthe FCC found that while 10 percent of Americans overall lacked access to fixed broadband services, the percentage was several times higher for those living on Tribal lands and in U.S. territories, especially in rural areas. Forty-one percent of those living on Tribal lands overall and 68 percent living in rural \ntribal communities lacked access. In U.S. territories, 66 percent overall lack fixed broadband access and \n98\u00a0percent living in rural territorial areas lacked access.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    56Barriers to Home Computer Access\nIn 2015, students in grades 4, 8, and 12",

However, the prevalence of other main reasons for no home internet access in 2010 differed from the pattern observed in 2015. In 2010, the most common main reason for children ages 3 to 18 not having home internet access was that it was too expensive (47 percent). Other main reasons for not having home internet access included that the family did not need it or were not interested in having it (22 percent), the home lacked a computer or a computer adequate for internet use (17 percent), the Internet could be used somewhere else (6 percent), and internet service was not available in the area (2 percent).Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    60Figure 10.3.

However, students have varying degrees of access at home to digital devices, such as desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones. The Computer Access and Familiarity Study (CAFS) was designed to measure student access to and familiarity with technology. The CAFS was conducted as part of the 2015 National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) and administered to public school students in grades 4, 8, and 12. This indicator uses the CAFS to examine the percentages of 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-grade public school students with their own or a shared digital device at home, by selected student or school characteristics. In 2015, higher percentages of 8th- and 12th-grade public school students (98 percent each) than 4th-grade students (95\u00a0percent) reported owning or sharing a digital device at home. At grades 8 and 12, few measurable differences were found by student and school characteristics because almost all public school students reported that they owned or shared a digital device at home.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    85Figure 13.1.

These barriers to DLR \nmay hamper students\u2019 ability to fully participate and engage in school. In contrast to the extensive body \nof research literature on the use of technology in classrooms (Donovan, Green, and Hartley 2010; Mouza 2008; Kent and Moore 2014; Rosen and Beck-Hill 2012; Eseryel et al. 2014; Larkin 2011), research on the relationship between students\u2019 access to DLR at home and their participation and engagement in the classroom has been more limited. This section begins with a summary of prior research on the relationship between students\u2019 home access to DLR and homework completion. Next, eight indicators \npresent analyses of the most recently available nationally and internationally representative survey data that \nexplore associations between DLR access at home and academic achievement for students with different individual and family characteristics. \nHomework Completion\nDeBell and Chapman (2006) used data from the 2003 Current Population Survey to analyze student habits with computers and the Internet inside and outside of the classroom.

The authors found that the majority of students in sixth grade and above used computers and the Internet to complete their \nhomework, with the percentage increasing as students advanced in their educational careers. The transition \nfrom traditional, paper-based homework assignments to online homework offers both advantages and disadvantages (Dodson 2014; Katz, Lee, and Byrne 2015). Shifting to an online homework approach may enable teachers to keep curriculum and materials current and relevant to classroom discussions, increase students\u2019 efficiency in submitting assignments and teachers\u2019 efficiency in providing feedback, and reduce the cost of paper materials. On the other hand, students may lack easy access to the Internet outside of \nschool, experience problems with the software or platforms used for online homework, and be distracted \nby multitasking; there may also be a greater potential for academic dishonesty.\nGui, Micheli, and Fiore (2014) used reading literacy data for Italy from the 2009 Program for International \nStudent Assessment (PISA) to investigate whether students\u2019 academic performance was related to their home internet use and socioeconomic background. They found that moderate users of the Internet\u2014those who used it at home for schoolwork once or twice a month to once or twice a week\u2014had higher scores \nthan those who used the Internet more than twice a week (frequently) and those who used the Internet \nless than once a month (infrequently). This pattern was observed for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Another study of 435 eighth-graders from five randomly chosen schools in Istanbul, Turkey, found that students enjoyed using computers and Internet tools for homework, and they developed a positive attitude toward doing homework on the computer and the Internet (Ongun, Altas, and Demirag 2011).\nWhile the focus of this report is on children between the ages of 3 to 18, research on the online \nhomework experiences of postsecondary students may nevertheless be relevant. Doorn, Janssen, and \nO\u2019Brien (2010) surveyed college students in 14 sections of seven economics courses on their attitudes \nand practices related to online homework.

The study found that students\u2019 previous experience with online systems, year in school, gender, and learning style had little relationship with their attitudes toward online homework, which indicated that its perceived benefits \nwere not limited to a particular group. \nAssociations Between Home Access to \nDLR and Academic Achievement\nThere is less research on relationships between students\u2019 \naccess to DLR at home and their participation and engagement in the classroom than on other topics more \nnarrowly focused on classroom activities. However, \nsome studies explored relationships between student computer access at home and academic outcomes, with mixed findings. While some studies of home computer access revealed positive correlations with academic performance (Jackson et al. 2006; Beltran, Das, and \nFairlie, 2010; Espinosa et al. 2006; Fish et al. 2008), \nothers found no relationship or negative relationships between home computer access and student achievement (Fairlie and Robinson 2013; Hunley et al. 2005; Vigdor, Ladd, and Martinez 2014). In addition, research on \nthe impact of instructional computer use in schools on \nacademic performance, including some randomized control trials and several quasi-experimental studies, found mixed results (Campuzano et al. 2009; Dynarski et al. 2007; Goolsbee and Guryan 2006; Shannon et al. 2015; Suhr et al. 2010; Chambers et al. 2011).\nThe eight indicators in this section describe differences \nin academic achievement associated with home computer \nuse and internet access for students with different individual and family characteristics. The results from the indicator analyses of national and international data sources consistently showed higher average achievement \nscores for students who used computers at home  \nand/or had internet access at home than for those who did not. This pattern was observed for students\u2019 reading, \nmathematics, and science performance ( Indicators 15, \n16, 17, 19, 20, and 21 ) and for students\u2019 knowledge \nof information",

However, the size of the achievement \ngaps between those who reported using a computer at home/having access to the Internet at home and those who did not varied by student and family \ncharacteristics. For an international reference point, \nIndicator 22  shows that a higher percentage of U.S. \n16- to 19-year-olds performed at the lowest proficiency level in problem solving in technology-rich environments than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD)\u00a0average. \nThe indicators in this section present bivariate statistics \nfrom a variety of sources to compare students\u2019 computer \nuse and internet access at home and their academic achievement. One of the limitations of bivariate statistics \nis that they describe subpopulation differences without \ntaking into account the influence of other individual, \nfamily, school, and environmental factors. Many of the \nacademic achievement variables examined in this report \nmay be related to other factors outside of students\u2019 \naccess to and use of computers and the Internet in their \nhomes. For example, achievement gaps between those \nwho reported using a computer at home/having access \nto the Internet at home and those who did not could \nbe influenced by other factors, including socioeconomic background characteristics such as parents\u2019 educational \nattainment and family income. Associations between \nsocioeconomic characteristics and DLR access are \npresented in Section 1 of this report. The design of \nthese surveys combined with the lack of comprehensive \nsocioeconomic metrics limits their use on this topic to \nprimarily descriptive indicators.

Similarly, the average reading scale score was higher for 8th-grade students who had access to the Internet at home (267) than for those who did not have access to the Internet at home (242).\nUsing data collected in the National Assessment of \nE\nducational Progress (NAEP) reading administration, \nthis indicator describes associations between students\u2019 computer use and internet access at home and their reading assessment scores. Achievement gaps between those who reported using a computer at home/having access to the Internet at home and those who did not could be influenced by other factors, including socioeconomic background characteristics such as parents\u2019 educational attainment and family income. 1 \nNAEP assesses student performance in reading at grades 4, 8, and 12 in both public and private schools across the nation. 2 NAEP reading assessments have been \nadministered periodically since 1992, with the most recent assessments occurring in 2015. The 2015 NAEP reading assessment was administered in a paper-and-pencil format. In addition to administering the reading assessment, NAEP includes a student questionnaire to provide context for student performance. The NAEP student questionnaire includes questions on demographics, as well as questions about students\u2019 use of computers and access to the Internet at home.\nIn 2015, average reading scale scores varied according \nto whether students reported that they used a computer at home and whether they had access to the Internet at home. Differences were observed at both grades, as well as across various student and school characteristics, including sex, racial/ethnic group, English language learner (ELL) status, school poverty status, 3 and school \nlocale.

Achievement gaps between those who reported using a computer at home/having access to the Internet at home and those who did not could be influenced by other factors, including socioeconomic background characteristics such as parents\u2019 educational attainment and family income. 1 NAEP assesses student performance \nin mathematics at grades 4, 8, and 12 in both public and private schools across the nation. 2 NAEP mathematics \nassessments have been administered periodically since 1992; the most recent were administered in 2015. The 2015 NAEP mathematics assessment was administered in a paper-and-pencil format. In addition to the assessment, NAEP includes a student questionnaire to provide context for student performance. The NAEP student questionnaire includes questions on demographics, as well as questions about students\u2019 use of computers and access to the Internet at home.\nIn 2015, average mathematics scale scores varied \naccording to whether students reported that they used a computer at home and whether they had access to the Internet at home. Differences were observed at grades 4 and 8, as well as across various student and school characteristics, including sex, racial/ethnic group, English language learner (ELL) status, school poverty status, 3 and school locale. NAEP mathematics scores \nrange from 0 to 500 for both grade levels. 4  \nOn the 2015 mathematics assessment, students who used a computer at home scored higher than those who did not use a computer at home. The average 8th-grade mathematics scale score was 285 for students who used a computer at home, compared with 262 for those who did not use a computer at home. The average 4th-grade mathematics scale score was 243 for students who used a computer at home, compared with 230 for those who did not use a computer at home. This pattern was consistently observed across student and school characteristics. For example, the average 8th-grade mathematics scale scores for students who used a computer at home and for those who did not were 287\u00a0vs. 265 for non-ELL students, and 249\u00a0vs. 239 for ELL students. Similarly, the average 8th-grade mathematics scale scores for students who used a computer at home and for those who did not were 302\u00a0vs. 275 for students in low-poverty schools and 266\u00a0vs. 256 for students in high-poverty schools.

The average science score was 156 for 8th-grade students who had access to the Internet at home, compared to 135 for those who did not have access. At grade 4, the average science score was 158 for students who had access to the Internet at home, compared to 133 for those who did not have access. This pattern was consistently observed across student and school characteristics. For example, the average 8th-grade science scale scores for students who had access to the Internet at home and those who did not were 157 vs. 136 for male students and 154 vs. 134 for female students. Similarly, the average 8th-grade science scale scores for students who had access to the Internet at home and for those who did not were 150 vs. 124 for students in city schools, 159 vs. 138 for students in suburban schools, 155\u00a0vs. 141 for students in town schools, and 158 vs. 141 for students in rural schools.\nThe differences in science scale scores between those \nwho had access to the Internet at home and those who did not varied by student and school characteristics. \nFor example, the 2015 score difference between White \n8th-grade students with access to the Internet at home \nand those without access (13 points) was smaller than the differences for Black and Hispanic 8th-grade students (21 points each). By school locale, the score difference was largest for 8th-grade students in city schools (26\u00a0percent), and larger for those in suburban schools (21\u00a0points) than for those in town schools (14 points). The 8th-grade score difference was not measurably different by sex, ELL status, or school poverty status. Some of the differences observed at grade 8 were not observed at grade 4. For instance, the science score difference associated with home internet access was not measurably different between White and Black 4th-grade students. Also, at grade 4 the science score difference was larger for students in city (29 points) and suburban schools (27 points) than for students in town (18 points) and rural schools (20 points).

Information and communication technology (ICT) 1 \nincludes computers and software learning tools, networking systems and protocols, hand-held digital devices, and other technologies for accessing, creating, and communicating information and for facilitating creative expression. Information and communication technologies are integrated into every sphere of contemporary life, and has profound implications for how people learn in school, solve practical problems, and function in the workplace. This indicator focuses on the content area of ICT to describe the associations between student achievement in ICT and computer use and internet access at home. \nThe TEL assessment was administered on a computer \nin 2014 for grade 8 in both public and private schools across the nation. In addition to the assessment, TEL also includes a student questionnaire to provide a context for student performance. The TEL student questionnaire includes questions on demographics, as well as TEL-specific questions about students\u2019 experiences with technology. In 2014, more than 90 \u00a0percent of 8th-graders reported they used a computer at home (91\u00a0percent) and they had access to the Internet at home (94 percent).\nIn 2014, average TEL ICT scale scores varied by whether \nstudents reported that they used a computer at home and whether they had access to the Internet at home. Differences were observed across various student and school characteristics, including sex, racial/ethnic group, ELL status, school poverty status, 2 and school locale. \nThe TEL ICT scores range from 0 to 300.

Achievement gaps between those who reported using a computer at home/having access to the Internet at home and those who did not could be influenced by other factors, including socioeconomic background characteristics such as parents\u2019 educational attainment and family income. 1 In PISA 2015, reading \nliteracy is defined as \u201can individual\u2019s capacity to understand, use, reflect on and engage with written texts, in order to achieve one\u2019s goals, to develop one\u2019s knowledge and potential, and to participate in society\u201d (OECD 2016b,\u00a0 p.\u00a0 13).

The survey is administered by answering questions via computer, although the survey can also be implemented via paper-and-pencil. PIAAC is developed and organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\nProblem solving and other cognitive skills in technology-\nrich environments are increasingly important in the economy and society of the 21st century. Problem solving in technology-rich environments is defined in PIAAC as using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks. PIAAC survey items in this domain present tasks of varying difficulty in simulated software applications using commands and functions commonly found in email, web pages, and spreadsheets. \nUsing PIAAC data from 2012, 2014, and 2015, this \nindicator describes the performance of U.S. 16- to 19-year-olds on the problem solving in technology-rich environments scale and differences in scores with respect to individual and family characteristics. In addition, this indicator compares the performance of U.S. 16- to 19-year-olds with their peers from selected OECD 1 and non-OECD countries and subnational \neducational systems. Although the indicator does not examine access to digital learning resources outside of the classroom, it does provide a general snapshot of 16- to 19-year-olds\u2019 capability of using digital learning resources by examining their performance in problem solving in technology-rich environments.PIAAC reports four levels for the problem solving in \ntechnology-rich environments scale: below level\u00a0 1, level\u00a01, level\u00a02, and level 3. Tasks at a higher level require using specific as well as generic technology applications, using multiple functions and navigation, performing a greater number of steps, generating subgoals, evaluating information, and applying higher-level forms of reasoning. 2 This indicator primarily focuses on \ndiscussions about the lowest (below level 1) and highest (level 3) proficiency levels. However, most analyses are limited to the lowest proficiency level due to the small percentage of 16- to 19-year-olds performing at the highest proficiency level. ",

The percentage of respondents assessed in this domain varied widely from country to country, because items on problem solving in technology-rich environments were administered only on computers. Some respondents elected not to take a computer-based assessment or were unable to do so because they had limited or no familiarity with computers. For these reasons, 7 percent of U.S. 16- to 19-year-olds were not assessed in problem solving in technology-rich environments.

However, based on the results of the literature search of empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals and government reports from 2005 to 2016, existing research on potential \nimpacts is lacking. Thus, the included studies and their results may not be representative. The handful of \nrelevant studies present very limited evidence regarding the relationship between teachers\u2019 knowledge of student access to and experience with DLR outside the classroom and instructional practices. A larger body of research is available on the challenges and barriers teachers and schools face in adapting instructional practices to further develop students\u2019 digital literacy skills for use of DLR both inside and outside of the classroom. \nWhat limited research is available on teachers\u2019 perceptions of disparities in student and parent internet \naccess at home suggests that these perceptions may impact their instructional decisions. For instance, a \nstudy conducted with 36 elementary and secondary school teachers who created course websites found that contextual barriers, including teacher perceptions that students could not access the Internet from home, resulted in the majority of teachers not using such websites on a regular basis (Friedman 2006). Teachers were concerned that parents who lacked home internet access would miss out on potential communication \nbenefits between home and school, and that students who lacked home access would not have an equal \nopportunity to view and complete assignments posted on the course website. Other research found that teachers tended to underestimate student access to DLR outside of the classroom because the teachers tended to focus primarily on access to computers and did not take into account student experience with other digital technologies, such as video game consoles (Henderson 2011; Honan 2008). Based on these perceptions, the author concluded that teachers tended to focus their lessons on familiarizing students \nwith operating computers",

Based on these perceptions, the author concluded that teachers tended to focus their lessons on familiarizing students \nwith operating computers (Honan 2008). \nAs student access to DLR outside of the classroom increases over time, educators may need to adapt \ninstructional practices in an effort to incorporate home-based technology into teaching and learning. A literature review conducted by Buabeng-Andoh in 2012 discusses individual, school, and technical factors that researchers have found to be associated with teachers\u2019 use of information and communication technology in the classroom. Conclusions from the literature review suggest that at the individual level, \nteachers are less likely to use technology in the classroom if they lack the confidence, skills, and pedagogical \ntraining to do so; if they do not perceive a benefit of using a new technology over current instructional approaches; or if they anticipate the new approach will be difficult or time-intensive to adopt. At the school level, technology experiences may be limited by organizational structures, such as an emphasis on traditional assessment and instructional methods or on restrictive curricula. Technical-level barriers include the absence of current and well-maintained hardware or appropriate instructional software, and \nlimited access to technology resources in the school. For example, a study by Reinhart, Thomas, and \nToriskie (2011) found that teachers in more affluent schools were more likely to have access to a technology facilitator who supported teachers with additional training on how to use technology to promote higher-order thinking skills. \nA second literature review conducted by Fu (2013) identifies similar barriers and challenges faced by \nteachers and schools as they work to integrate technology into the learning environment. Benefits of using Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    150technology-based instructional activities in classrooms \ncan include providing tools for students to access digital information effectively, supporting student-centered \nand self-directed learning, providing a creative learning \nenvironment by accessing text through different types of DLR, encouraging collaborative distance-learning, offering opportunities to develop critical thinking skills, and facilitating access to course content. However, findings from the literature review suggest that schools \nmay face challenges or experience barriers to technology \nuse due to students\u2019 inadequate technical skills that hinder",

However, findings from the literature review suggest that schools \nmay face challenges or experience barriers to technology \nuse due to students\u2019 inadequate technical skills that hinder their ability to participate in a classroom that uses DLR, students\u2019 lack of timely feedback from instructors, and their reduced interaction with classmates and \nteachers. In addition to the teacher- and school-level \nbarriers noted in the Buabeng-Andoh (2012) review, Fu also breaks out the influences of DLR use into external and internal components. External factors include the availability and accessibility of technology equipment and logistical constraints such as faculty teaching and \nplanning time and technical and administrative support. \nInternal factors include teachers\u2019 beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions about technology use and integration, self-confidence and technology self-efficacy, and readiness to use DLR in the classroom. Fu concluded that both internal and external factors impact the level of effort teachers put into integrating technology into their \ninstruction.\nA more recent study of 24 middle school science teachers \nand 1,060 students in two states also found that teachers \nexperience barriers in their efforts to integrate technology \ninto instruction (Wang et al. 2014). Researchers found \nthat while teachers and students use a variety of DLR outside of the classroom, teachers\u2019 application of \ntechnology in classroom use was limited due to a lack \nof access to technology resources and support, a lack of \ntechnology integration skills and strategies, and a lack \nof time to plan for technology integration. Although \nstudents used technology outside of the classroom to \nwork on school projects, the study found that most \nstudents were not familiar with the skills needed to use \ntechnology to solve problems, enhance productivity, or \ndevelop creativity. This study\u2019s authors concluded that \nafter teachers introduced a new technology to support learning, students typically learned it quickly and were \neager to use more technology in their classrooms.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    151Section 5: Interventions at State and Local Levels\nState and local interventions to increase access to digital learning resources (DLR) and the Internet both \ninside and outside of the classroom are underway across the United States.

This section describes a few examples of such interventions conducted in 2015 and 2016 (2015 being the most recent data year reported \nin the indicators and 2016 being the year before the report was in production). For this section, we had \nlimited ability to address the Congressional mandate within the timeframe and scope of this report. We searched for relevant reports on technology, but did not identify any national data or evaluations addressing systematic efforts to address DLR access at home. We did identify some reports published by political organizations and advocacy groups, and provided some examples of state and local efforts from those reports. It is important to understand that these examples are not representative of all the types of \nefforts that are currently being made. It is likely that there are other examples of state and local initiatives \nthat are not discussed here because reports were not produced about these efforts within the time frame that we used for our search procedures.\nState-Level Interventions\nThe nonprofit organization EducationSuperHighway aims to provide high-speed internet access to all U.S. public school students. In the 2015 State of the States  report, EducationSuperHighway (2015) stated \nthat an additional 20 million students were connected to high-speed internet over the past 2 years and \nthat 38\u00a0governors had committed to the initiative of connecting their states\u2019 classrooms to high-speed \nbroadband. For example, North Carolina launched the Wireless Networking Initiative, a statewide procurement effort that resulted in 95 percent of participating school districts having Wi-Fi access points in every classroom. New Jersey formed a statewide buying consortium for broadband services in schools that resulted in 16\u00a0percent savings on monthly costs and an average internet access bandwidth increase of 152 percent.\nThe State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) works to ensure that students have \nequitable access to DLR, both inside and outside of the classroom. In the 2016 report The Broadband \nImperative II: Equitable Access for Learning , SETDA identified three strategies that policymakers and \neducators can use to improve equity of access outside of school: reaching out to families about the necessity \nof out-of-school access, leveraging community partnerships, and sharing out",

These strategies rely on community buy-in, such as local businesses offering internet \naccess on their premises to students. Similar local initiatives are described below.\nLocal-Level Interventions\nAt the local level, some stakeholders are using creative methods to try to help close the digital divide. \nCommunity outreach and education campaigns are often more effective than federal funding alone (LaRose et al. 2011). In 2015, the Executive Office of the President released the Community-Based Broadband \nSolutions  report, encouraging the construction of broadband networks in unserved and underserved areas.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    152Some districts are putting wireless routers on buses \nor providing mobile Wi-Fi hotspots so that students can access the Internet outside of the classroom. In \nCalifornia, the Coachella Valley Unified School District \nhelped low-income residents obtain access by outfitting school buses with high-speed internet for use by students on the way to and from school and in the evening hours for homes near the parked buses (U.S.\u00a0Department of Education n.d.). The Vail School District in Arizona \nimplemented a similar initiative (Fox and Jones 2016). \nWhen Cincinnati Public Schools decided to offer partially-online advanced placement (AP) courses, the school system provided mobile hotspots, called Kajeet SmartSpots, to students who did not have home \nbroadband access (Meyer 2016). These hotspots not \nonly allowed students to attend their AP classes, but also to complete homework. Forsyth County Schools in Georgia partnered with the Cumming-Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce to disseminate a list of organizations and businesses in the community that \noffered free Wi-Fi hotspots (Fox and Jones 2016).\nFunding programs and providing devices for students \nare other common local-level strategies to increase student internet access to DLR outside the classroom.

    "text": " for students \nare other common local-level strategies to increase student internet access to DLR outside the classroom. School District 87 of Bloomington, Illinois provided sixth- through eighth-graders with a digital learning \ndevice to use at both school and home (Fox and Jones \n2016). Since over half of the students did not have at-home internet access, the district also decided to allocate funding to provide low-income households with access to the district\u2019s internet connection. Cincinnati\u2019s Kajeet SmartSpots program caught the interest of Green Bay \nArea Public Schools in Wisconsin. Instead of supplying \nmobile hotspots, however, the school district allowed students to \u201ccheck-out\u201d a SmartSpot laptop or other device, similar to borrowing a book from the library (Meyer 2016).\nAs a final example, the national nonprofit organization \nEveryoneOn works as a liaison between internet service \nproviders and families that cannot afford broadband internet (Meyer 2016). The organization negotiates with internet service providers for more affordable prices for high-speed internet service and computers, and then helps inform families about these opportunities in their \nareas.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    153References\nBeltran, D.O., Das, K.K., and Fairlie, R.W.

It includes both multiple-choice items and constructed-\nresponse items (those requiring written answers). Results are reported in two ways: by average score and \nby achievement level. Average scores are reported for the nation, for participating states and jurisdictions, \nand for subgroups of the population. Percentages of students performing at or above three achievement \nlevels ( Basic, Proficient, and Advanced ) are also reported for these groups.  \nFrom 1990 until 2001, main NAEP was conducted for states and other jurisdictions that chose to participate. \nIn 2002, under the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, all states began to participate in \nmain NAEP, and an aggregate of all state samples replaced the separate national sample. (School district-\nlevel assessments\u2014under the Trial Urban District Assessment [TUDA] program\u2014also began in 2002.)  \nResults are available for the mathematics assessments administered in 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, \n2013, and 2015. In 2005, NAGB called for the development of a new mathematics framework. The revisions \nmade to the mathematics framework for the 2005 assessment were intended to reflect recent curricular \nemphases and better assess the specific objectives for students at each grade level.\nThe revised mathematics framework focuses on two dimensions: mathematical content and cognitive \ndemand. By considering these two dimensions for each item in the assessment, the framework ensures that NAEP assesses an appropriate balance of content, as well as a variety of ways of knowing and doing \nmathematics.\nSince the 2005 changes to the mathematics framework were minimal for grades 4 and 8, comparisons \nover time can be made between assessments conducted before and after the framework\u2019s implementation \nfor these grades. The changes that the 2005 framework made to the grade 12 assessment, however, were too drastic to allow grade 12 results from before and after implementation to be directly compared. These \nchanges included adding more questions on algebra, data analysis, and probability to reflect changes in high \nschool mathematics standards and coursework; merging the measurement and geometry content areas; and \nchanging the reporting scale from 0\u2013500 to 0\u2013300.

In 2009, a new framework was developed for the 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-grade NAEP \nreading assessments.\nBoth a content alignment study and a reading trend, or bridge, study were conducted to determine if the \nnew reading assessment was comparable to the prior assessment. Overall, the results of the special analyses Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    158suggested that the assessments were similar in terms \nof their item and scale characteristics and the results \nthey produced for important demographic groups of \nstudents. Thus, it was determined that the results of the 2009 reading assessment could still be compared to \nthose from earlier assessment years, thereby maintaining \nthe trend lines first established in 1992.

In the July supplement, questions about \ncomputer and internet use are the principal focus. \nThe current sample design, introduced in July 2001, \nincludes about 72,000 households. Each month about \n58,900 of the 72,000 households are eligible for interview, and of those, 7 to 10 percent are not interviewed because \nof temporary absence or unavailability.

In addition, supplemental questions regarding school enrollment \nare asked about eligible household members ages 3 and \nolder in the October survey. Prior to July 2001, data were collected in the CPS from about 50,000 dwelling units. \nThe samples are initially selected based on the decennial \ncensus files and are periodically updated to reflect new housing construction. \nA major redesign of the CPS was implemented in January \n1994 to improve the quality of the data collected. Survey questions were revised, new questions were added, and computer-assisted interviewing methods were used for the survey data collection.

Thus, estimates of levels for data collected in 1994 and later years will differ from those \nfor earlier years by more than what could be attributed to \nactual changes in the population. These differences could be disproportionately greater for certain subpopulation groups than for the total population.Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom     |    160Beginning in 2003, the race/ethnicity questions were \nexpanded. Information on people of Two or more races was included, and the Asian and Pacific Islander \nrace category was split into two categories\u2014Asian and \nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. In addition, questions were reworded to make it clear that self-reported data on race/ethnicity should reflect the race/ethnicity with which the responder identifies, rather than what may be written in official documentation.\nThe estimation procedure employed for monthly CPS \ndata involves inflating weighted sample results to \nindependent estimates of characteristics of the civilian noninstitutional population in the United States by age, sex, and race. These independent estimates are based on statistics from decennial censuses; statistics on births, \ndeaths, immigration, and emigration; and statistics \non the population in the armed services. Generalized standard error tables are provided in the Current Population Reports; methods for deriving standard errors can be found within the CPS technical documentation at http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-\ndocumentation/complete.html . The CPS data are subject \nto both nonsampling and sampling errors.\nPrior to 2009, standard errors were estimated using \nthe generalized variance function. The generalized variance function is a simple model that expresses the \nvariance as a function of the expected value of a survey \nestimate.

Prior to 2001, the October supplement consisted of approximately 47,000 interviewed households. Beginning with the October 2001 supplement, the sample was expanded by 9,000 to \na total of approximately 56,000 interviewed households. \nThe main sources of nonsampling variability in the responses to the supplement are those inherent in the survey instrument. The question of current enrollment may not be answered accurately for various reasons. Some respondents may not know current grade information \nfor every student in the household, a problem especially \nprevalent for households with members in college or in nursery school. Confusion over college credits or hours taken by a student may make it difficult to determine the year in which the student is enrolled. Problems may \noccur with the definition of nursery school (a group \nor class organized to provide educational experiences for children) where respondents\u2019 interpretations of \u201ceducational experiences\u201d vary. \nFor the October 2015 basic CPS, the household-level \nnonresponse rate was 12.9 percent. The person-level nonresponse rate for the school enrollment supplement \nwas an additional 8.9 percent. Since the basic CPS \nnonresponse rate is a household-level rate and the school enrollment supplement nonresponse rate is a person-level rate, these rates cannot be combined to derive an overall nonresponse rate. Nonresponding households may have \nfewer persons than interviewed ones, so combining these \nrates may lead to an overestimate",

TIMSS collects information through mathematics and science assessments and questionnaires. The questionnaires request information to help provide a context for student performance. They focus on such \ntopics as students\u2019 attitudes and beliefs about learning \nmathematics and science, what students do as part of their mathematics and science lessons, students\u2019 completion of homework, and their lives both in and outside of school; teachers\u2019 perceptions of their preparedness for teaching \nmathematics and science, teaching assignments, class size \nand organization, instructional content and practices, collaboration with other teachers, and participation in professional development activities; and principals\u2019 viewpoints on policy and budget responsibilities, curriculum and instruction issues, and student behavior. \nThe questionnaires also elicit information on the \norganization of schools and courses. The assessments and questionnaires are designed to specifications in a guiding framework. The TIMSS framework describes the mathematics and science content to be assessed and \nprovides grade-specific objectives, an overview of the \nassessment design, and guidelines for item development. \nTIMSS is on a 4-year cycle. Data collections occurred in \n1995, 1999 (8th grade only), 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015. TIMSS 2015 consisted of five assessments: 4th-grade mathematics; numeracy (a less difficult version of 4th-grade mathematics, newly developed for 2015); 8th-grade \nmathematics; 4th-grade science; and 8th-grade science. \nIn addition to the 4th- and 8th-grade assessments, the third administration of TIMSS Advanced since 1995 was conducted. TIMSS Advanced assessed final-year (12th-grade) secondary students\u2019 achievement in advanced \nmathematics and physics.

Either there are too few cases for a reliable estimate or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50\npercent or greater.\n1Most of the education systems represent complete countries, bu t some represent subnational en tities; examples include two\nCanadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec), a component of the United Kingdom (England), the U.S. state of Florida, and afew individual cities (such as Abu Dhabi within the United Arab Emirates).\n2Teachers were asked how often they had students do the following five activities on computers during science lessons: prac-\ntice skills and procedures; look up ideas and information; do science procedures or experiments; study natural phenomenathrough simulations; and process and analyze data. The overall frequency of computer use corresponds to the highest fre-quency reported for any one of these activities. \n3The total of all students who have computers available during lessons includes students for whom data on the specific type\nof computer access is missing. Their teachers indicated that computers were available to students during lessons, but eitherfailed to answer the three follow-up questions about specific type of computer access or answered \u201cNo\u201d to each of the three\ntypes of access. Among sampled students with computers available during science lessons, about 3 percent are missing data\non the type of computer access; however, the percentage varies widely by country (from 0 to 28 percent). These students areincluded in the total shown in column 4, but are not included in columns 5 through 7.\n4Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the\nscale centerpoint set at 500 and the standard deviation set at 100. 5The international average includes only education systems that are members of the International Association for the Evalua-\ntion of Educational Achievement (IEA",

Includes only children who\nresided with at least one of their parents.NOTE: Data are based on sample surveys of the civilian noninsti tutionalized population, which excludes persons in the military\nand persons living in institutions (e.g., prisons or nursing facilities). Data for 2015 were collected in the July supplement to the\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS), while data for 2010 were collected in the October supplement. The July supplement consists\nsolely of questions about computer and internet use. In contrast, the October supplement focuses on school enrollment,although it also includes questions about computer and internet use. Measurable differences in estimates across years could\nreflect actual changes in the population; however, differences could also reflect seasonal variations in data collection or dif fer-\nences between the content of the July and October supplements. Therefore, caution should be used when making year-to-year\ncomparisons. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

The poverty universe includes all children who are related to the householder by birth,\nmarriage, or adoption and includes unrelated children age 15 and over. The householder is theperson (or one of the people) who owns or rents (maintains) the housing unit. Poverty status is\ndetermined by the total family income of the householder for related children and individual\nincome for unrelated children. Poverty status cannot be determined for unrelated children underage 15 (e.g., foster children) because their family and individual income is not known.\n2Percentages refer to students whose household members access the Internet at home by the\nmeans specified. \u201cEither no access or only dial-up access\u201d includes households where no mem-ber accesses the Internet at home as well as households where members access the Internetonly with a dial-up service.\n3Excludes mobile broadband, but includes all other non-dial-",

In 2015, for example, the poverty threshold\nfor a family of four with two children was $24,036. Respondents were interviewed throughout theyear and reported on the income they received during the previous 12 months.\nNOTE: Data are based on sample surveys of the entire population residing within the United\nStates. However, this table includes only students living in households, because respondents liv-ing in group quarters (e.g., shelters, healthcare fac ilities, or correctional facilities) were not asked\nabout internet access. Some students living in households were also excluded from this table,\nbecause their poverty status could not be determined (see footnote 1). As noted in footnote 5,\nthe Census Bureau determines poverty status using a set of money income thresholds that varyby family size and composition. For additional information about poverty status, see https://\nwww.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html . Detail may\nnot sum to totals because of rounding.\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau, American Community Survey\n(ACS), 2015. (This table was prepared January 2017.)Table 218.70.

For\nexample, England and Northern Ireland are both part of the United Kingdom (UK).\n2Items on the problem solving in technology-rich environments domain were offered only on\ncomputer. This column shows the percentages of 16- to 19-year-old respondents who werenot assessed in this domain because they were unable to or elected not to take a com-puter-based assessment. \n3For each country/region, percentages are based on only those 16- to 19-year-old respon-\ndents who were assessed in the domain of problem solving in technology-rich environ-ments, which is defined as \u201cusing digital technology, communication tools, and networks toacquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks.\u201d \n4The proficiency levels correspond to the following score ranges on a scale of 0 to 500:\nbelow level 1 (0-240.9), level 1 (241.0-290.9),  level 2 (291.0-340.9), and level 3 (341.0-\n500.0). Tasks at a higher level are more demanding in terms of requirements such as using\nspecific as well as generic technology applications, using multiple functions and navigation,\nperforming a greater number of steps, generating subgoals, evaluating information, andapplying higher level forms of reasoning.

It focuses on a review of academic literature  and draws on \nextensive research  to detail the  use and impact of digital technology in education. The review \nfeatures examples of how digital technology is  used to enable effective learning outcomes, \nassist system improvements , and how these systems can support teachers.  \nThere is a strong consensus that digital technology can improve teaching and learning by \nmotivating students with engaging, interactive, an d fun learning environments. For example, \ndigital technology offers new avenues of meaningful communication and collaboration \nbetween teachers and students. Integrating  into classroom practice  communicative digital tools , \nsuch as online forums  and digital storytelling , enables core academic learning to be expressed \nand explored via multimedia conversations and exchanges. Moreover, digital technology can \nopen dialogue between various cultures and countries to promote purposeful intercultural \ncommunication and collaboration. In turn, these online interactions create further opportunities \nto develop digital literacy, 21st century skills, and digital citizenship.  \nDigital technology  also opens immersive educational spaces, giv ing students novel lear ning \nopportunities.

Interactive digital tools , such as problem -solving games, modelling software and \n3D printing , support cognitive development and allow students to understand abstract concepts, \nvisualise virtual objects, and produce tangible artefacts. By engaging  in dynamic digital \nenvironments, students can view and discuss key concepts  from different perspectives.  \nEarly childhood math ematics  and language learning makes extensive use  of digital tools, such \nas play -based math s, vocabulary and reading a pps. Special  education has benefited from apps \non touch screen devices, as the interfaces allow for easy navigation, which in turn assist s in \nbridging differential access to technology. Apps provide  engaging, interactive, and fun learning \nspaces ; they enable students to strengthen established knowledge by exploring meaningful \napplications of skills, strategies, and rules. However , teachers should maintain a central role  by \nproviding students with initial instruction, adequate scaffolding and formative feedback \nthroughout app -assisted learning activities.  \nSchools use digital technology to inform student progress and lea rning outcomes and to \noptimise work procedures. Interconnected digital systems provi de support across the entire  \neducation system . The use of integrated digital platforms and systems to deliver a steady data \nstream is increasing  and helps to develop robust learning analytics .

Introduction  \nOur future society will be dominated by artificial intelligence ( AI) and advanced technology \nand automation, requiring the next  generation of citizens entering the workforce to be \ntechnology savvy. This future,  however, starts now, and ensur ing high quality integration of \ntechnology in  schools  is required  to help shape and build the digital society. According to \nUNESCO (2021) , one of the main aims of education is to prepare future  generations for th is \ndigital future,  and to equip them  to deal with the rapid development of technologies, cope with \nthe continuous access to vast amounts of new knowledge and information, and foster cr itical \nthinking, sense -making, creativity and collaboration skills to excel in digital contexts. \nUNESCO  emphasi ses the importance of governments and schools having a digital strategy that \noffers guidance on how to implement digital systems, technologies, digital learning design , and \npedagogy and to benchmark performance against evidence -based criteria and conditions for \nsuccess.  \nThe c urrent digital strategy of the Department for Education South Australia is at the end of its \nlife cycle. Developing a new digital strategy presents an opportunity to recast technology from \na targeted resource lever to a transformational tool and a driver o f world -class teaching and \nlearning in South Australia.  Digital technology can be adopted and integrated to improve \nteaching and learning experiences ; maintain modern, smart, efficient and streamlined \nworkplaces ; and prepare children and young people to le arn, live and work in a digital world . \nSimilar to other educational transformation frameworks, such as Microsoft Educational \nFramework (2014) , ISTE Essential Conditions (2016)  and Haynes and Shelton (2018) , the new \nstrategy aims to guide a holistic change  and draws on evidence to facilitate a well -structed and \nrigorous process.  \nThe following literature review situates the use of digital technology in education within the \ncontext of research evidence.

The guiding question for this literature review i s: \n\u2022 What does the academic literature tell us about the use of digital technologies  for: \no effective learning outcomes ? \no system improvements  and teacher  requirements for support ? \nThe findings of this literature review are presented to inform the Department\u2019s digital strategy, \nsupporting the aim of maximising the potential of digital technology to achieve world -class \neducation for South Australians.  \n2. Methodology  \nThis review is limited to academic peer -reviewed journal articles published between 2016 \nand2021 . The Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC) database, a widely used \ndatabase speciali sing in indexing education research, was used to search for academic peer -\nreview ed journal articles focusing on technology use in pre -school (early learning), primary  \n2 and secondary education and the use of digital technology or systems to facilitate data -driven \ndecision -making in schools. We included two search strings for each of the focus areas of the \nresearch question (learning outcomes, system improvements, teacher support) , one addressing \nthe use of digital technology, the other addressing data -driven decision making.  \nSearch strings used in ERIC:  \nSearch 1  - Learning Outcomes : \n1a (digital  technolog*) AND (learning outcomes)   \n1b (data -driven) AND (learning outcomes)   \n \nSearch 2  - System Improvements : \n2a (digital  technolog*) AND (system improvement)  \n2b (data -driven) AND (system improvement)   \n \nSearch 3  - Teacher Support  \n3a (digital  technolog*) AND (teacher) AND (support)  \n3b (data -driven) AND (teacher) AND (support)  \nThese searches returned a total of 333 articles that matched our criteria .

As a rough indication we found, \n24 small studies (1 -15 participants), 47 medium -size studies (N  = 16-100), and 17 large studies \n(N > 100). Where indicated  by the authors , 38 studies were qualitative, 25 were quantitative \nand 42 re ported a mixed -method approach. Of the data collection methods discussed, \ninterviews were the  most widely used approach, followed by survey s and test scores , and then \nobservations.  \nOur findings are presented in Sections 3 and 4.  \n3. Improved and enhanced teaching and learning  \nDigital technologies are used in  education  to provide engaging learning environments that \ninspire and motivate students to learn.  They  have long been heralded as a means for educational \ntransformation. Various  research  has es tablished  connections between digital technologies and \nstudent engagement, motivation, and positive learning outcomes  (Fokides & Kefallinou, 2020; \nHeindl & Nader, 2018; Kotsari & Smyrnaiou, 2017; Moyer et al., 2018) . This involves opening  \nclassrooms to eng age in connected learning and exploration beyond the boundaries of the \nschool , and incorporating technologies into the curriculum to facilitate diverse  and flexible \ndeliver y of content . Technology can also increase inclusivity, equity and social responsibi lity \nby providing a learning environment that inspires students and prepares them for a technology -\nfocused society. The included empirical papers indicate the value of digital technologies mostly \nthrough teachers\u2019 perceptions and experiences working with these technologies.  Just as there \nis a range of digital tools investigated, the contexts in which the studies are conducted are also \nquite diverse , providing insight into the ways that technology can be integrated into the \ncurriculum to meet a variety of intended outcomes.  The studies are predominantly focused on \nsingle use technologies in small to medium size studies. They  may point to improved stud ent \nlearning outcomes, but it is difficult to infer or judge system -level implications.

Below, we will \npresent short illustrations of studies to highlight technology use and its impact on teaching and \nlearning.   \n4 3.1 Communication and collaboration   \nThe research  shows that  digital learning activities , which promote purposeful communication  \nand collaboration amongst teachers and students , open greater opportunities to converse in \ncreative and meaningful ways  when compared to non -digital lear ning activities . Integrating \ncommunicative digital tools , into classroom practice such as Facebook and discussion forums , \ncan support core learning area s and digital literacy  across subjects, foster 21 st century skills , \nand cultivate cultural awareness  and digital citizenship . \nFor example, Buckley -Marudas (2016)  examined online discussion forums to study \nmulticultural teaching and learning in connection  to race, language, class, and other identities \nsalient to classroom communities. The research posits a pedagogical  approach which \ncontextualises multiculturalism within core learning areas, drawing upon digital media to \ncultivate culturally responsive education. In Year 10 English classes, topics related to language, \nidentity and stereotypes were launched in a forum, and students were invited to share their \nideas a nd opinions in an informal, yet respectful manner. The findings revealed that students \nbecame more democratic citizens. Rather than judging or disrespecting those who may be \nperceived as \u2018different\u2019, students developed a deeper appreciation of each other \u2019s differences  \nand perspectives . They found that t he online forum cultivated open, contrasting , views and \nopinions, while also enhancing students\u2019  critical literacy skills.  \nFurther , Carreon (2018)  investigated Facebook as an online teaching tool to supplement \ntraditional classroom practices . The aim of the study was to examine how using Facebook  as \nan online discussion forum  affected learning outcomes amongst  Year 7 students in the \nPhilippines . A closed Facebook group was created to share  and discuss  a range of learning \nmaterials  and subjects via multi -media and written posts , and audio -video presentations . The \nfindings assert that  students who engaged with the closed Facebook group  improved \nsignificantly in learning performance ",

The \nfindings assert that  students who engaged with the closed Facebook group  improved \nsignificantly in learning performance  compared to students  who did not engage . The results \nconcluded  that Facebook augmented learning outcomes  by allow ing students to determine their \nown learning  pace,  and time and place , similar to  learning management systems with built -in \ndiscussion forum capability . The study suggests that these practices enable learn er autonomy, \nstrengthen communication  and collaboration , and fosters students\u2019  confidence  and motivation  \nduring interaction s (Carreon, 2018).  \nThe research demonstrate s that meaningful student engagement can be cultivated  using \ninteractive digital technologies . Digital communication and collaboration tools can create \ncross -curricular  educational backdrops , which  set the stage for academic learning  in \nconjunction with improving digital literacy , 21st century skills  and learning outcomes  (Chang \net al., 2018; Ciampa, 2017; Niemi et al., 2018; Oakley et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2020) . \nHowever, the direct application of such communication and collaboration tools  into \neducation al contexts needs to be carefully considered , particularly the use of Facebook , or \nsimilar external ly managed  discussion forums . Where available , learning ma nagement s ystems \nowned by educational institutions with embedded discussion  forum capability should be used \nto ensure student privacy of data is maintained , and avoiding the necessity for students to use \npersonal Facebook accounts for educational purposes.   \n5 3.2 Digital storytelling (DST)  \nWhile conventional bookmaking and storytelling have a rich tradition in schools, the use of \ntechnologies to support  story planning, design and sharing e nables students\u2019 oral and written \ncommunication  skills to be built alongside digital literacy skills. Digital storytelling (DST) is \na multimedia presentation  of narratives , that combines a range of media such as text, images, \nvideo, audio, and interactive elements , to tell a story.  \nA study  by Eubanks et al.

The research  observed Year 2 students , in a Chinese primary school language class , \nparticipat ing in daily writing lesson s. The students \u2019 story writing process was scaffolded with \ncustomary materials  such as , paper and crayons , by which they sketched story maps before  \ndigitally acti oning  their stories via various iPad apps . Digital capability includ ed voice and \nvideo recording, inserting illustrations and images, handwritten or keyboard text, and  the use \nof a specific Book Creator app to create and pu blish their stories . The object of this study was \nto determine if using DST influenced students\u2019 ability , and attitudes towards , writing  stories . \nThe findings showed a significant increase in students\u2019 Chinese writing ability, engagement, \nand motivation. Moreover,  improvement in students\u2019 speaking, reading, and listening skills as \nlanguage learners  was also noted. The study deems that a digital  hands -on approach to langu age \nlearning is met with positive student attitudes, which contributes to favourable learning \noutcomes.  \nFurther, a  study  on an  Australia \u2013China Council venture  for middle school students in Australia \nand China  (Oakley et al., 2018)  examined how  shared digital stories about their everyday lives , \nlocal cultures, and traditional tales  impacted learning outcomes related to intercultural  \nunderstanding . Using teachers \u2019 observations and perspectives, the research found that DST was \na novel  means to pra ctice  English and foreign  language skills, and facilitate  cross cultural \nunderstanding, 21 st century skills and digital literacy.  However, the teachers also identified \nvarious challenges , such as dealing with emergent cultural and pedagogical differences, \nincompatible technologies, and contrasting  security  restrictions impacting the ability to use \nshared platforms.

To truly tap into the project\u2019s potential,  the study asserts that online  cultural \nexchanges need further explor ation , as students will need linguistic, cultural and digital skills \nto effectively engage  with our ever -growing globalised  world.  \nThe research highlights the potential and possibilities of DST  to develop core languag e skills  \nin tandem  with digital literacy. Moreover, w hen DST is  coupled with far -reaching digital \ncommunication and collaboration technologies , it can create an array of student learning \nopportunities and outcomes , and inspire  innovative cross -cultural communication and learning  \n(Oakley et al., 2018) .  \n3.3 Language learning  \nLanguage learning relies on  digital technologies and tools  to facilitate vocabulary up -take, \nunderstanding and retention. However, a study by Vungthong et al. (2017) highlight s the \nimportance of integrating  pedagogical guid ance to help construct  and convey  meaning in \nlanguage learning , rather than relying on technology alone . Vungthong et al . (2017) \ninvestigated how songs in apps aid English as a foreign language (EFL)  learners . In particular ,  \n6 the research explored how  interactive audio -visual songs  develop  vocabulary awareness and \nunderstanding in primary school children , when delivered on computers and touch screen \ndevices.  The purpose  of the stu dy was to determine  the relationship between images and \nlanguage , and how  video  with songs on apps facilitated  meaning \u2013making . The research \nexamined 23 videos  with songs  geared towards  Grade 1 and 2  learners , focusing primarily on \nthe images and lyrics  of individual frames to explore visual -verbal relations.  While songs are \nconsidered an enjoyable  method to engage students and promote  vocabulary , the findings show \nthat images and lyrics cannot solely  facilitate vocabulary uptake and understanding. Similarly, \nvideos with songs  or similar materials  presented on apps cannot  exclusively  support students \u2019 \nunderstanding of abstract terms , or words with varied contextualised meanings , and need to be \naccompanied with pedagogical guidance .  \nThe findings presented by Vungthong et al.

(2017)  are echoed in a systematic review  by Eutsler \net al. (2020) , which explored the influence of touch screen apps on English language \nacquisition for early learners to Year 5 students. The y found  that studies reporting positive \nlearning outcomes focused on singular literacy domains, such as phonics, vocabulary and \ncomprehension. Thus, the review  suggests that apps designed to target specific language \ncomponents are of most educational value. Beyond targeting certain language skills, the studies  \ncould n ot determine if the apps ha ve any effect on augmenting broader language and literacy \ndevelopment, as significant findings could not be established (Eutsler et al., 2020 ). Therefore , \nthe role of English  teachers cannot be \u2018outsourced \u2019 to digital language teaching materials  alone , \nas teachers  continue to play a critical role in supporting students to contextuali se and develop \ncompre hension of  particular words (Vungthong et al., 2017) .  \nA further study  by Wilkes et al . (2020) point s to the importance of technology  and teachers \nworking in unison to augment language learning  outcomes.  They  examined  the use of digital \ntools in a blended learning setting to augment reading  proficiency.  The purpose of the study \nwas to determine if digital technologies and tools could better facilitate  English langu age and \nliteracy outcomes  in early  childhood education . The research revealed that a technology -based  \nreading skills program  was most effective only when coupled with reading  guidance  from \nteachers . These studies  highlight that certain resources , delivered by digital technologies and  \ntools , should be seen as supplemental materials  as opposed to teacher  substitutes  (Wilkes et al., \n2020) .  \n3.4 Math ematics  literacy  \nInteractive d igital technology can provide dynamic math s instruction in everyday classroom \npractice  by enhanc ing the learning process and  making math s concep ts more understandable .  \nA study  by Niemi et al.

(2018)  investigated how  maths literacy c an be developed in fun and \nactive learning environments  combined with DST  to help enhance maths literacy. The object \nof the study was to learn if DST could be applied to different educational contexts beyond \nlanguage and literacy learning, and to observe its effectiveness as a math ematical  teaching \napproach.  Students aged 10 to 11 applied  DTS to convey and dis cuss geometry concepts though \nillustrated narrations . The findings indicate that DST  motivates learning and encourages \nstudents to explore , apply and communicate  math ematics  to each other using these novel \nmethods.   \n7 Disney et al. (2019) examined play-based pedagogy, widely used in early childhood education, \nto study  if play -based numeracy apps aided math s awareness and growth by building on \npreviously acquired skills. Specifically, the aim of the research was to i mplement five play-\nbased learning apps for three - to four-year-olds, and test for increased knowledge in \u2018numerical \nidentification, counting, arithmetic problems, shape identification and patterns \u2019 (p. 171).  The \nfindings suggest that age specific numeracy apps can facilitate math s literacy, as overall \nincreased performance was noted across the student cohort. However, the apps only serve as a \npractice platform to develop pre -taught maths concepts, rather than teach foundational math s \nskills. Thus, the research asserts that math s apps cannot replace initial numeracy instruction, as \nthese digital tools extend rather than augment learning (Disney et al., 2019) . The study \ndemonstrated that digital play -based learning can facilitate maths literacy, as ch ildren learnt by \nengaging and exploring maths concepts to further establish  knowledge by applying skills, \nstrategies, concepts and rules in play -based math s apps.  \n3.5 Flipped learning  \nFlipped learning provides students with video lectures and other learner s upport materials \ndesigned to teach and guide",

This allows valuable class time \nto be spent on more engaging and collaborative activities.  \nA study  by Graziano and Hall (2017)  looked into flipped learning  for newly arrived English \nlanguage learners in mainstream public high schools in the U.S. The aim of the study was to \ndetermine whether flipped algebra instruction impacted the student s\u2019 math s learning outcomes.  \nThe results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the academic \nperformance of students enrolled in algebra with flipped instruction compared to students \nenrolled in the same course with no flipped instruction  \nIn general , studies find that flipped learning  has a positive effect on engagement, the ability to \nself-pace learning, and t he provision of instant discussion and feedback during class time . \nHowever, it may not demonstrate additional learning gain when contrasted with traditional \napproaches. Regardless  of student learning performance , the flipped learning students did find \nthe videos and  in-class activities to be helpful for improving their English speaking and literacy \nskills  (Graziano & Hall, 2017) . Current studies on flipped learning are limited , however, and \nthere are no conclusive or generali sable findings that can be derived from the literature (Hung, \n2015) . \n3.6 Gamification  \nAlthough educational games have been integrated into teaching  practices for decades, digital  \ngames are now being recognised for their ability to improve student learning though increased \ncogniti ve activity, learning gain, and motivation  (Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2013; Hamari et al., 2014) . \nOne study by Soboleva (2019)  investigated the use of mobile game applications to support \n\u2018quests\u2019, whereby students use d interactive mobile apps to find educational content on their \nown to solve problems.

A series \nof workshops were held to familiarise teachers with the  technology and  use of educational apps \nbefore being used in classrooms. However, it should be noted that the apps explored were not \ndesigned specifically for teaching purposes but had generic content. There are currently few \neducational AR/VR apps .

They found eight  articles that \nmatched their search criteria and concluded that the use of AR can benefit child learning \noutcomes in the reported areas of drama, reading and alphabet learning, and art. AR was found \nto support child engagement, persistence, concentration and cre ativity.

The use of AR allowed children to explore objects from different perspectives \nsupporting concept acquisition and development.

SV s are \nfilmed by cameras, which capture images covering a 3D sphere instead of capturing images \nfrom restricted angles . The SVs  can be played on computers, smartphones, and head sets  \n10 (Siegle, 2019) . The aim of the research was to establish whether SVs, embedded into interactive \napps, are useful teaching tools in comparison to printed material and web pages. The study also \nexamined students\u2019 attitudes towards SVs. The findings assert that SVs improve students\u2019 \nknowledge uptake and retention compared to other teaching tools. Additionally, students \nshowed favourable attitudes towards learning with SVs. Fokides and Kefalli nou (2020) suggest \nthat an increased feeling of presence in SVs contributes to learning, as users are exposed to \nvirtual realit ies and experiences, which enables understanding s of concepts, processes and \nproblems. Moreover, the study asserts that the fun n ature  of the experience , and the feeling of \nimmersion  within  SVs, enhances learning outcomes, by facilitat ing enjoyment and thus \nincreas ing engagement and motivation to learn (Fokides & Kefallinou, 2020) .

The experiment \nevaluated students\u2019 differences in creativity, race forecast accuracy, and learning performance \n(Chien, 2017) . The results showed that students who used design software and 3D printers \nsignificantly outperformed students who made their cars by hand  with respect to creativity \n(novelty, sophistication and functionality ) and their ability to  predict rac ing outcomes. \nHowever there was no sigificant difference in learning performance between the two groups. \nAn overall evaluation of learning performance was carried out by three in -service technology \nteachers  by giving each student a score from 0 to 100.  While learning performance was similar \nfor all students in this experiment, this research shows that utilising technology can foster a \nvisual depth of understanding, and add richness to learning by allowing st udents to \nconceptualise, design and create with a dynamic digital perspective.  \nChien\u2019s (2017) research suggests that design software and 3D printers enable students to \nflexibly employ STEM knowledge, capitalise on creativity, create novel sophisticated car s that \nmeet basic engineering standards, and calculate race outcomes.

(2017)  explored how primary school students with developmental disabilities can \nacquire science vocabulary and digital literacy skills via touch screen devices. The purpose of \nthe study was to observe how digital tools , such as multimedia shared stories including  video  \nand written texts, can be  used to mediate knowledge building and model touch screen skills. \nThe study found that these tools facilitate academic and functional learning and , when used in  \n11 conjunction with multimedia theory principles, are integral for special education (Rivera et al., \n2017) . Moreover, research on middle school and high school students using touch screen \ndevices has shown favourable outcomes in special educatio n. For example, one study reported  \nthat using iPads empowered students to be \u2018experts\u2019 while concurrently improving their digital \nskills, and helped bridge differential access to technology (Ciampa, 2017) .

This section also presents a key digita l learning initiative, based on \nbringing your own device ( BYOD ), by discussing the results of a recent study  in New Zealand . \n4.1 ePortfolios  \nA modern school  workplace should provide teachers and administrators with technologies or \nsystems to help inform student progress and optimise work processes. It is essential that several \nsystems are connected and provide information to support the workflow. The integration of \ndigital portfolios  (also known as \u2018e Portfolios \u2019) into schools and teaching practices can be  seen \nas an example of improving the educational workplace. ePortfolios are defined as a digitised \ncollection of artifacts reflecting student achievement to document the process of student \nlearning as well as its outcomes. ePortfolios have been most successful in terms of creating \nopportunities for project -based learning, increasing student reflection, as well as increasing \ncommunication between staff and  parents. Further, th e use of the digital ePortfolios increase s \nthe opportunity for related service professionals to assess student development in particular \ndomains.  \nA case  study  by Clancy and Gardner (2017 ), which aimed at exploring ePortfolios in action, \ndemonstrates the capability of digital technology to optimise the educat ional workplace .

At a systems level , researchers have recently argue d for the development \nof data lakes and data integration to perform learning analytics at scale and support the uptake \nof artificial intelligence to enable real -time feedback (De Laat et al., 2020) . The aim of this \nwork is , for example , to improve the stude nt learning experience  and well -being to support \ngrowth . Traditional approaches to assessing learning and tracking progress for all learners, \nespecially Indigenous and under served  populations, in acquiring needed skills and mindsets  \n13 are inadequ ate to meet this challenge. Digital data enables the development of learner profiles \n(Kovanovi\u0107, 2020)  to measure and shape student learning gains and provide adaptive and \npersonalised guidance and feedback.  \nWhile learning analytics, artificial intelligenc e, and the development of learner profiles are in \ntheir infancy in early years, primary, and  high school education, there have been advances in \ndata-driven decision making in recent years. Even though  data-driven decision making \n(DDDM) in schools strongly relies on data from standardised surveys and classroom \nobservation  (Dudek et al., 2019; Fallon et al., 2019; Singh, 2018) , the use of integrated digital \nplatforms and systems to provide a steady data stream is on the rise .

With such systems in \nplace , DDDM can be utilised more effectively to detect learner differences, address \npersonalised learning, and augment students\u2019 learning achievements.  DDDM appears \nconducive to making informed decisions concerning student capabilities.  \nFor example, a study by Bradbury (2019)  examined the process of datafication in  early \nchildhood education. Fundamentally, this process situates data as an inherent component  of the \neducational envi ronment , embedded in the teaching and learning cycle , and which  inform s and \nguide s instruction to make  iterative ch anges to facilitate optimal learning outcomes. Bradbury\u2019s  \nstudy aimed  to investigate  how ongoing data collection on phonics assessments facilitates \naccurate student grouping according to ability levels. The findings suggest that the combination \nof data analysis and teachers\u2019 observations assists informed decision making and systematic \norganisation, enabling  instructors to meet learner differences, and therefore, improve students\u2019 \nlearning outcomes (Bradbury, 2019) . \nAnother paper (Buzhardt et al., 2020 ) explored how DDDM can assist educators to identify \nand provide personalised gu idance to early learners who require extra literacy and language \nsupport. The results show ed that progress monitoring data systems enable  early detection of \nunderperforming children, and thus  assist  teachers and parents to respond accordingly by \nimple menting individualised strategies to facilitate language development (Buzhardt et al., \n2020) .  \nRecent technological advances have led to novel wear -able real -time analytics tools that \nsupport teachers\u2019 data -driven decision making  (De Laat et al., 2020) . One such tool, Lumilo, \nis designed for teachers to receive real -time information about how students are faring while \nthey complete software -based mathematical activities on the computer in class  (Holstein et al., \n2019) .

The use of Lumilo had a mediating effect \nand narrowed the gap in learning outcomes across students with different prior knowledge \n(Holstein et al., 2019)  by providing teachers with information that they otherwise would not \nhave had access to, helping them identify students who require additional assistance.  \nFurther, the design and use of data -driven systems , such as learning analytics tools in K -12 \nclassrooms , suggest s that it is important to engage teachers (or non -technical stakeholders) \nthroughout the entire design process  (Holstein et al., 2019) . The advantage is that co -design \nprocesses help to centre discussions on needs  and possible teacher int erventions , rather than on \nthe specific type of analytics and technical considerations. It also helps to ensure usefulness \nand ideas on how to inform instructional decision  making and actioning in the context of  \n14 specific tasks and scenarios.  However, while some research on learning analytics has been \nexplored in schools, it has largely been investigated within higher education ; therefore, there \nis limited knowledge of the specific challenges for schools in the K -12 space (OECD, 2021) . \n4.3 Professional dev elopment  \nAs the previous sections have d emonstrated , teaching and learning in education can be \nsupported through effective digital strategies.

High quality support \nand professional development is critical for a ll teachers , not only those who may be enthusiastic \nor early to trial different technologies. However, research is still needed to unpack broader \nrequirements and impact at the system  level  scale .  \nStudies included in this review suggest that teachers agree that there are benefits for using \ndigital technology in teaching and learning  (Al-Hezam, 2017; Fokides & Kefallinou, 2020; \nFransson et al., 2020) . Al-Hezam (2017)  reported that teachers  identified benefit s of digital \ntechnology as including ease of information delivery and attractiveness of the tools to students \n(p. 51).  Success in integrating and using digital technologies in education is , however , driven \nby well-informed teachers and quality leadership. Well-informed and high -quality teachers \ndrive quality  education (Hopkins & Stern, 1996) . Thus, teachers should be consulted and \ninvolved  throughout the digital strategi sing process. To build and impart digital knowledge, \nteachers can contribut e through collaborative  involv ement  in developing digital strategies and \nresources . Being part of this processes enables teachers to  become  well equipped, have \nownership , and maintain teach er agenc y (Clancy & Gardner, 2017; Misfeldt & Zacho, 2016) . \nMurray  et al.

Many of the articles included in this literature review \nstrongly point to these aspects, and forefront the need for professional development to support \nthe use of digital technologies in tea ching and learning (Callaghan et al., 2018; Ciampa, 2017; \nClancy & Gardner, 2017; Dirckinck -Hol",

For \ndigital tec hnologies to be effective, it is evident that teacher support and professional \ndevelopmen t requires on going investment and attention . \nGlobally, t eachers  are moderately ready for the implementation of a digital curriculum. This is \nprimarily  due to two main findings , the first being technical readiness and the second being \npedagogical readiness.  Both of these factors are  influenced by time constraints, lack of \nknowledge and skills, and infrastructure and technical support (Al-Awidi & Aldhafeeri, 2017) . \nCallaghan et al. (2018)  concluded further that identifying resources that teachers find both easy \nto use and relevant to their teaching may be the key to technology integration and , ultimately, \nincrease student learning (Callaghan et al., 2018 , p. 18).   \n4.4 Teacher engagement  and ownership  \nDigitali sation of teacher workplaces and leadership can facilitate teacher engagement and \ninvolvement in educational transformation. Some studies explicitly pointed to the added value \nof engaging teachers in the design and implementation of digital technologies in schools. \nClancy and Gardner (2017)  recommend teacher engagement in communities of  practice and \nusing participatory design (Holstein et al., 2019) , future workshop, or scenario design (Misfeldt \n& Zacho, 2016)  approaches to actively involve teachers in discussions and decisions around \nthe use of digital technologies. This is especially important as being involved in decision -\nmaking processes around the adoption of digital technologies approaches affords the teachers \na sense of ownership (Clancy & Gardner, 2017) . \nSun and Gao (2019)  explored  the role of school leaders and teachers during a school -wide \nreform project aimed at using digital technologies to adopt a flipped learning model.

To enact this leadership,  the school \ndeveloped pedagogical and organisational systems that support collaborati on and shared  \nlearning experiences . This helped teachers develop four new roles as learners , researchers, \ncollaborators and  facilitat ors of  student -centred learning.  The school was able to successfully \nimplement  this new teaching model  incrementally over time.  New policies and curriculum were \ndeveloped  which  reinforce d notions of a supportive teaching environment and provision of \nprofessional development. In  stages,  the model was adopted  by teachers conducting  research ,  \n16 and additional training was offered . A technology coordinator assisted with effective \nimplementation : \u2018The changing teacher role from the authority to facilitator of students -centred  \nlearning resulted from both the learning and the teaching practice supported by ICT.

During this change some teachers also began resear ching \ntheir practices to support better pedagogy and to improve  their teaching and learning.  \n4.5 Bring your own device  \nThe Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy has been largely adopted across a range of school \nsystems and countries. While they all may have a di fferent flavour, the  policies  have some \nsimilarities. One case study conducted by Adhikari et al.

The BYOD policy brought changes to computer self -efficacy among learners , \nas well as changes in attitude s towards student  learning. Based on interviews with teachers \ninvolved, they found a gradual disappearance of the boundaries between formal and informal \nlearning spaces to allow for participation in  learning activities and collaboration. It was found \nthat learning activities that started in the classroom could be worked on colla boratively and \ncompleted  from anywhere  (for example , from home) . It was also found that differe nt modes of \ncollaborative activities resulted in  improved student motivation. This in turn helped teachers to \nchange their whole curricular strategy to maximise the potential benefit of BYOD policy. The \nteachers also concluded that the BYOD pol icy strongly contributed to improving learning \noutcomes. Some of the concerns that were raised during the study relate , for example , to the \ntechnological infrastructure. A unified approach around the learning management systems and \nother tools to support overall learning activities  was lacking . There was an absence of a \ncommon workflow model that supported or articulated processes and procedures  at an \norgani sational level . \nOverall, the findings point to positive improvements in school and classroom curricular \npractices in a bid to achieve success of the BYOD policy.

This h as contributed to learners being more \nindependent and taking  greater responsibility for their learning.   \n17 5. Conclusion  \nThe complex educational ecosystem involving students, parents, teachers , and school systems \nis highly interconnected.  Digital technology  provide s positive learning outcomes , inspiring and \nmotivating to students as learners in a digital world beyond the constraints of the classroom. \nTo learn, collaborate and connect in a digital world , students need to develop 21 st century skills \nin unison with using digital technologies. Creat ing connected and communicative online and \nface-to-face learning spaces, assisted by digital technologies and tools, could support learning \ninnovation, engage and motivate students, and enable students to develop vital skillsets to \nbecome job -ready in the futur e, particularly if equitable access to digital technology is enabled . \nTeachers play an important role in this ecosystem. They provide a voice to how those systems \ncan be  developed to support the educational outcomes for students. To best support student \nlearning it is highlighted that teachers need professional development  and agency in their \nteaching and learning practices. Other digital strategies explored across OECD co untries , as \npublished in a recent working paper (OECD, 2021) , highlight the importance of government \npolicy and the development of specific digital strategies to improve teaching and learning and \nbuild proficiency in the educational workforce. This literat ure review identified that teacher \ncompetency and overall digital literacy skills can be developed with appropriate teacher -\nfocussed training. T eacher engagement, support and professional development are crucial \nfactor s for the successful integration o f digital technologies in education.  Innovative \nprofessional development, which caters to collective and individual teachers\u2019 technological \nneeds , may need to be implemented.  \nThere is also acknowledgement around student data and how this can be used to in form more \nsystem -wide decision  making. However, this decision making needs to be completed \ncollaboratively  and in context .

    "text": " be completed \ncollaboratively  and in context . Results from the research highlighted the need for distributed \nschool leadership  that was spread across the  school and across  various roles? including the \nprincipal, to administrators and teachers. Any systems implemented should foster collaboration \nand maintain learning communities amongst stakeholders to create a collective school culture ; \nfor example princip als and teachers, administrators and teachers, teachers and teachers, and \nteachers and parents , and students.  \nIn addition, p rincipals and teachers may need to upskill in data analysis to assist them in \nformulating approaches and strategies (with other stakeholders) in response to emergent \nstudent needs (or make predictions of future student needs) from information generated fro m \neducational  data more broadly . Currently, d ata-driven decision making in schools strongly \nrelies on data from standardised surveys and classroom observation, however the use of \nintegrated digital platforms and systems to provide a steady data stream is o n the rise.  \nMany studies explored in this review focussed on single -use technologies in single classrooms \n(i.e. case studies) rather than across a whole school or school district/area context.  \nOverall , further  studies are needed to explore digital technologies across multiple contexts \nwithin a student \u2019s school week, year or between years across specialist curriculum content \nrather than individualised studies that do not interconnect across a student \u2019s whole lea rning  \n18 journey. However, the findings gleaned from the studies provide suggestions for the ways that \ndigital technology could enhance learning outcomes and be integrated into school systems.  \n   \n19 6.

During school closures, more than two-thirds \nof children globally were unable to access online learning (UNICEF and ITU, 2020).

Children\u2019s own lack of digital skills, even in wealthier countries, can also stand in \nthe way; children from the poorest families feel less confident in their capacity to cope with \ndigital learning activities (Vuorikari et al. 2020) . \nDesigning content for specific context and learning goals are vital for effective learn -\ning platforms. Incentivized by the pandemic and school closures, the digitalization of ed -\nucation is leading to profound changes. Evidence increasingly shows that digital learning \nis more effective when embedded in a clear pedagogical framework supporting teachers \n(Tamim et al., 2011). It raises new challenges regarding the role and required skills needed for \nteachers to effectively deploy technology. \nShifting to more digital learning can change children\u2019s daily routines.

BRIDGE THE ELECTRICAL AND DIGITAL DIVIDES:  \nPROVIDE ALL CHILDREN WITH AFFORDABLE ACCESS  \nTO HIGH-QUALITY ONLINE RESOURCES\nDigital technologies have the potential to deliver education content widely and rapidly.  \nHowever, the promise of digital learning remains out of reach for most of the world\u2019s children. \nDigital devices require electricity. World Bank data show that, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only \n47% of the population has access to electricity and progress in electrification is slow. Dispar -\nities also exist within countries.3 In some countries, less than 10% of the poorest households \nhave electricity (Dreesen et al. 2020). Even with connectivity and access, lack of electricity \nwould still prevent children in many parts of the world from using the internet. \nIn terms of connectivity, an estimated 2.2 billion \u2013 or two thirds \u2013 of children and young peo -\nple worldwide do not have a fixed internet connection at home (UNICEF 2020). These chil -\ndren predominantly live in the least developed countries where 4G mobile networks cover \nonly 40% of the population, compared to 85% of the global population (ITU 2020). \nWhile detailed statistics on the proportion of child internet users remain scarce, internet \nuse by children is usually associated with country wealth (Kardefelt-Winther et al. 2020; see \nFigure 1). \nEven in high-income countries, where internet use seems ubiquitous,  inequities persist.

The kind of engagement and whether it is beneficial, highlighted as \u2018mean -\ningful connectivity\u2019 by the Broadband Commission,4 is equally important. For example, even \na family with a broadband connection, or a mobile phone with 3G/4G technology, might not \nbe able to afford going online in a meaningful way or for sufficient amounts of time. \nEven with improved connectivity and more affordable data and devices, many children are \nstill not able or allowed to use the internet for their benefit. Digital divides \u2013 linked to so -\ncial norms, poverty, gender, limited skills and literacy and availability of relevant content \n(EQUALS, 2019; Datta et al., 2020) \u2013 endure even after connectivity is provided. \nEfforts to provide meaningful access to children must, therefore, address more than just \nconnectivity and infrastructure. Poor and marginalised girls and boys, including those with \ndisabilities, \u2018children on the move\u20195 and those living in remote areas, are often left out of ed -\nucation. Moreover, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience \na stressful home environment \u2013 with no quiet space to study or limited or lack of devices, for \nexample \u2013 and parents who face financial and job security pressure that can prevent them \nfrom supporting their children (Di Pietro et al. 2020).  However, with specific learning provi -\nsions in place that ensure inclusivity and accessibility, technologies can be game-changing \nfor vulnerable groups. \nQuick wins can stem from using readily available technology already familiar to children \nand families (Trucano, 2013).

Still, only a small proportion of chil -\ndren own these devices (Lobe et al., 2021), which limits their access and use, and ownership \nis not synonymous with having digital devices that are appropriate for learning (Cachia et \nal., forthcoming ).\nTechnologies evolve rapidly. Today\u2019s high-speed internet will soon be low-speed. Invest -\nments in infrastructure should ensure that marginalised communities are not left behind \nand can in fact leapfrog to higher speed networks. At the same time, digital learning solu -\ntions should be accessible to those with varying levels of connectivity. To reach all children \nrequires finding the right balance between producing high-quality, interactive content, \nwhile also optimising applications and content to be lightweight and function with low or \nno bandwidth. \nTo address the digital divide and enable equitable digital learning: \n1. Invest in electricity and connectivity with a focus on marginalised communities \nand users. Coordinated, large scale investments from G20 member states, national \ngovernments and the private sector are needed to bring electricity and connectivity \nto the millions of unconnected children around the world. Based on current trends, \nSub-Saharan Africa won\u2019t reach electricity for all before 2081. This can, however, be ac -\ncelerated through partnerships and significant capital investments to the enormous \nbenefit of children and their future societies and economies. The GIGA initiative, for \ninstance, leverages public-private partnerships to digitally connect every school, espe -\ncially those hardest-to-reach.

Much depends on how  technology is used within a learning \nsystem (Bulman and Fairlie, 2016). Digital solutions are effective in improving learning when \nthey supplement and support teachers rather than replace them (Tamim et al. 2011). \nTo support the implementation and scale of effective digital and blended learning: \n1. Develop a clear pedagogical approach to guide the use of digital learning from \na young age . Digital initiatives work best when they are underpinned by pedagog -\nic principles and incorporated into the educational process (Redecker et al. 2017). \nCo-creation between software developers and educators helps ensure that digital \nprogrammes are fit for their educational purposes (Karamperidou et al. 2020).

PROTECT CHILDREN\u2019S WELL-BEING AND SAFETY\nChildren need the time and space to be children. This includes time to play and interact \nfreely with peers, online and offline. During COVID-19, the world witnessed a sudden shift of \nmany children\u2019s activities into the digital world. The online world offered new possibilities, \nincluding as a substitute for in-person interactions. In general, children handled lockdown \nin reasonable and resilient ways.\nHowever, research also reveals profound changes in children\u2019s daily lives during the pandemic. \nFor instance, with digital learning added to their existing online entertainment activities \u2013 im -\nportant to maintain a sense of normalcy \u2013 children (10-18 years old) across Europe now spend \nmost of the day online (Vuorikari R. et al. 2020; Lobe B. et al. 2021). For some, being in lockdown \nhas meant greater exposure to domestic violence, abuse or exploitation. Children with pre-ex -\nisting physical or mental health conditions, or in vulnerable socio-economic contexts, have also \nfaced added hardship (Marques de Miranda D. et al. 2020; Mascheroni et al. 2021; Europol 2020). \nMoreover, the digital environment, like any other, comes with a range of risks for children. \nOne of the most severe is sexual exploitation and abuse, experienced either virtually or with \ndigital technology as a facilitator of physical abuse. \nUniversal digital access (see section 1) and effective digital learning (see section 2) for every \nchild can be successfully achieved only if the risks to children\u2019s online safety and well-being \nare addressed.\nTo protect children\u2019s well-being,",

Provide psychological assistance and develop concrete guidelines for children, \nparents and caregivers to help manage the transition to digital learning during crises \nsuch as COVID-19. These should include ways to maintain healthy sleeping patterns, \nschool-life balance, social life and quality family time. Some children have reported \ndigital fatigue and boredom towards technology as a result of increased time online. \nThis calls for a better balance between digital learning and other activities, and more \ntime for play (Vuorikari et al. 2020; Cachia et al. forthcoming ). PROPOSAL\nDIGITAL LEARNING FOR EVERY CHILD: CLOSING THE GAPS FOR AN INCLUSIVE AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE\n9\n2. Protect children\u2019s security online and avoid biases against vulnerable groups by \nensuring that digital learning solutions have built-in safeguards. With increased \nexperiences online, vulnerable children can find themselves more exposed to risks \nand less able to find support (Stoilova et al. 2021). Industry commitment and clear pol -\nicy guidance and dialogue between stakeholders is imperative for developing strate -\ngies (EU COM 2012, 196 final), norms, rules and regulations to protect children\u2019s safe -\nty, security, privacy and ownership in the digital world. A first step toward universally \nagreed legal standards is to review government frameworks that effectively protect \nchildren\u2019s rights in the digital world and to assess these against relevant international \nlaws and conventions. Developing safe-by-design products should be prioritised by \nthe industry with a view to keeping up with rapid technological change.\n3. Implement innovative, child-friendly prevention and response strategies for chil -\ndren at risk of violence, abuse or exploitation online.

By comprehensively analyzing the viewpoints of \nseveral researchers, digital learning  could be divided into four parts (Keane,  2012) . \n(1) Digital teaching materials : It emphasizes that learners  could learn by extra cting some \ndigital teaching material  contents. The so -called digital teaching material  contents refer to \ne-books , digitalized data , or contents presented with other digital methods.   \n(2) Digital tools : It stresses on learners  proceeding learning activity  through digital tools , such \nas desktop computers , notebook computers , tablet computers , and smart phones . \n(3) Digital delivery : It emphasizes that learners\u2019  learning activity  could  be delivered through \nthe Internet , e.g. intranet , internet , and satellite broa dcasting . \n(4) Autonomous learning : It focuses on learners  engaging in online or offline learning activity  \nthrough digital learning  by themselves.

On the  other  hand, learning also requires some driving force \nand extrinsic motivation  as it is common to learn for parent expectation, added objectives, and \nacqu isition of some incentive s. Learning motivation  is a mediator  between stimulation and \nreaction. In other words, learning motivation  is a learner\u2019s  individual opinions about affairs, \nand learners  would present different  knowledge acquisition needs because o f distinct \nopinions.  Karim  (2012)  regarded learning motivation  as the inherent belief  to guide individual \nlearning goal , induce learning behaviors  to make continuous efforts, reinforce cognition \nhistory , and strengthen and improve the learning outcome . Gruzd et al. (2012)  argued that \nstudent s would  expect to receive incentive s from others for the behaviors ; in this case, learning \nwas purposive, but could possibly be transformed from extrinsic  into intrinsic motivation . \nAlthough students  might not be autonom ous, the acquisition of some achievement motivation  \nor the transform ation into the needs for self -growth in the learning process  would be a good \nmotivation internalization  process. Ones with intrinsic learning motivation  did not need \nincentives, could  independently make decisions, and acquire d fun and sense of achievement  \nin the process. E xtrinsic motivation , on the other hand, was the learning motivation  induced \nby others \u2019 rewards or punishment and identity to certain behavioral value. I ntrinsic \nmotiv ation  might be more autonomous and persistent with high value, but environmental \nfactors  could  also influence motivation  that incentives  and external support  were necessary \n(Im et al., 2011) . Koff & Mullis (2011)  regarded learning motivation  as student  intention or \ndesire to participate in and make efforts on learning, which was performed on student  choice \nof specific learning activity  and the efforts on such activity .

(2012)  also proved that students  preferred \nindependently solving problems on certain work (the behaviors were driven by intrinsic \nmotivation ), but would be helped  by teachers to solve some learning problems  (the behaviors \nare promoted by external stimulation). In learning, students\u2019  intrinsic interests and teachers \u2019 \nor parents \u2019 extrinsic rewards could  be cooperated to form the learning motivation . According \nto abov e research, intrinsic motivation  and extrinsic motivation  are used as the measure \ndimensions of learning motivation  in this study.  \nLearning outcome  \nKatz et al. (2011)  indicated that the words academic performance , learning outcome , \nacademic achievement , or learning achievement  expressed the same  ideas, i.e. students\u2019  \nacademic learning outcome , or the persistent result through learning history .

Martin & Herrero (2012)  \nalso found out the significant differences between learning mode  and learning outcome , but \nthe effect of learning mode  on learning outcome  became insignificant after using multimedia \nassisted teaching materials . Hsu (2012)  pointed out two dimensions in learning outcome . \n(1) Learning effect \uff0dincluding test result , time for schedule completion, and academic \nachievement.  \n(2) Learning gain \uff0dcontaining learning satisfaction , achievement , and preference . \nLearn ing effect  and learning gain  are therefore utilized as the measure dimensions of \nteaching effectiveness  in this study.  \nComparison between traditional teaching and digital learning  \nMcKiernan (2011)  pointed out various differences in teaching material conten ts, \nlearning channels , and practice methods between traditional teaching  and digital learning . For \ninstance, learning contents  focusing on convenience  and flexibility were suitable for digital \nlearning , while traditional teaching  was better for courses whi ch required practical operation \nor teamwork.  Although digital learning  could  not completely replace  traditional teaching , it \ncould  achieve the best teaching effect and have learners  be glad to learn by reinforcing \ntraditional teaching  with digital learning and comprehensively practicing both methods in \nteaching activity . Yien et al. (2011)  pointed out the difference  between digital learning  and \ntraditional teaching  in learning environment  and persons.  Traditional teaching , with \u201clectur e\u201d \nin classrooms, was the most traditional and representative teaching method. In short, it \nreferred to instructors  delivering teaching materials  in the teaching activity  to learners  through \ninterpretation .

In addition to the \ntime backg round, it was rapidly developed because it broke through traditional teaching  \nmodes and presented various strengths.  Miyoshi et al. (2012)  organized the advantages of \ndigital learning  for the comparison with traditional teaching . (1) Learning no problem : Digital \nlearning  allowed learners  not being restricted on time  and space as traditional learning so that \nlearners  could  select the time and location for online learning and had no pressure and obstacle \nof time and space through the instructors\u2019  online inter action mechanism  (Jude et al., 2014) . (2) \nRich network resources : The Internet  covers rich and diverse information  that learners  could \nacquire data simply by searching key words . When a digital learning  platform was able to  \n \n \n \n \n \nM.-H. Lin et al.  / Digital Learning on Learning Motivation and Learning Outcome  \n3558  organize relevant resources for the use or connection of learners , network resources  would  be \neffectively applied through digital learning , and instructors  or learners  could acquire richer \ninformation  beyond teaching materials  in the curriculum to enhance the learning effect (Im et \nal., 2011) . (3) Digital learning contents  and tailored learning schedule : Learners  were equally \ntreated in traditional teaching  for same teaching schedule  and contents, regardless of learners\u2019  \nlevel. However, the curriculum desig n and the production  of teaching materials  for d igital \nlearning  were digital contents  that learners  could  freely select different  courses and teaching \nmaterials , according to the level and preference , to achieve the tailored learning outcome (Sun \net al., 2 012). (4) Complete records of learners\u2019 learning history : A good digital learning  \nplatform should  be able to completely record learners\u2019  learning history  so that instructors  \ncould  understand learners\u2019  learning conditions  and learners  could  clearly realize the level or \nlearning outcome  for adjustment and improvement.

(5) Interactive learning : Digital learning  \nwas self -learning that the production of teaching materials  should cover more media pictures , \nsound , or images  than traditional ones to generate more attractive and lively teaching \nmaterials . Moreover, digital teaching  platforms would provide interactive functions like chat  \nroom and discussion for more two-way communication  between learners  and instructors  and \namo ng learners  (Hockly,  2012) . (6) Reduction of teaching costs : The teaching material contents \nutilized in a digital teaching  platform were kept as digital files  that the completed teaching \nmaterials  could  be repeatedly utilized . In other words, the teaching material contents made by \ninstructors  before  lessons allowed learners  using for several times and learning  repeatedly. \nTraditional teaching required all learners  gathering at the same time and same place for the \ninstruction that the teaching costs were inc reased.  (7) Effective accumulation of knowledge : \nThe digital learning mode  could systematically and completely record all online teaching \nmaterials  and learners\u2019  learning history .

These technologies are also positioned as mechanisms for \neducational reform via transformation of teacher practice. It seems, however, that wide- scale \ntransformation of te acher practice and digital learning remain unrealized. This is commonly a t-\ntributed to a range of challenges associated with extrinsic and intrinsic influences, which while \nacknowledged, are not well conceptualized. Using evidence from a case study of teach ers wor k-\ning to transform their practice with digital technologies, this paper presents a tri -theory fram e-\nwork that was used to conceptualize these challenges. Activity Theory provided a mechanism for \nteachers to identify extrinsic influences in activity sy stems then contextualize and reduce the pe r-\nceived significance of challenging contradictions.

Transformative Learning Theory is \npresented as a mechanism to explain the interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic influences during the teachers\u2019 collaborative attempts to  consciously transform  their practice.

They are \nalso necessary to satisfy curriculum expectations and facilitate Science- Technology- Engineering-\nMathematics (STEM) education (AiGroup, 2016) . \nDespite considerable funding for the provision of digital technologies for schools in Australia (Aus-\ntralian National Audit Office, 2011 ) and overseas, \nthe reformative and transformat ive capacity of dig i-\ntal technologies has not been widely realized (Wastiau et al., 2013) .

Digital Learning -  Conceptualizing Challenges & Influences  \n536 dent learning is mixed (Zheng, Warschauer, Lin, & Chang, 2016) . Digital technologies are more \ncommonly used to e nhance existing teacher practice than transform it (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-\nLeftwich, 2013; Ha mmond, 2013; Shear, Gal lagher, & Patel, 2011; Wastiau et al., 2013) . The \nlack of reformation and transformation is attributed to a range of challenging extrinsic and intri n-\nsic influences on teacher practice that can become  barriers . Extrinsic influences  occur in  the co n-\ntext into which digital technologies are introduced. Intrinsic influences  relate to personal cha l-\nlenges faced by the ind ividual teacher (Ertmer, Ottenbreit -Leftwich, Sa dik, Sendurur, & S en-\ndurur, 2012 ). The realization of digital learning occurs through the transformation of teacher \npractice at the confluence of i nteracting extrinsic and intrinsic influences.  Limited evidence for \nthe realization of digital learning strongly suggests the  need for a framework for researchers and \nteachers to conceptualize the apparent complexity of these influences.  \nThis paper offers a tri -theory framework for conceptualizing the context and challenges of tran s-\nforming teacher practice using digital technolo gies to actualize digital learning, specifically , con-\ntradictions in teachers\u2019 activity systems, the disruption of teacher routines, and the influence of \nattitudes and beliefs. The term \u2018digital technologies \u2019 is used to broadly describe vario us hardware \nand software tools, including information communication technologies  (ICT),  that can be used to \ncollect, store, process , and action data as well as facilitate creative and critical thinking, problem \nsolving, collaboration, and communication. The term digital learning is used to broadly describe a \nwide range of educational opportunities made possible by digital technologies (Dobrovolny, E d-\nwards, Friend, & Harrington, 2015) .

Evidence from a case study is used to illustrate how the tri -\ntheory framework conceptualizes the challenges of realizing digital learning for students through \nchanges in teacher practice. The framework is a synthesis of three theoretical lenses. Second and \nthird  generation Activity Theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 2009a)  is used in the literature (Nielsen, Miller, & \nHoban, 2012) , and in this paper, as an analytical tool for extrinsic influences on digital technol o-\ngy integration. System 1 and System 2 Thinking Theory (Kahneman, 2011)  is positioned as a \ncomplementary tool to conceptualize the roles of routines, attitudes , and beliefs as intrinsic infl u-\nences on teacher practice. Transformative Learning Theory (Mezirow, 2009)  is offered to conce p-\ntualize the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic influences when reshaping practice for im proved \ndigital learning. The paper concludes that teachers can collaboratively use the tri -theory fram e-\nwork to conceptualiz e the challenges of transformation of teacher practice to actualize digital \nlearning.  \nLiterature Review  \nLike film, radio , and televis ion, digital technologies are positioned as important tools for refor-\nmation or transformation of schooling (Howard & Mozejko, 2015) . Rationales for the integration \nof digital technologi es include improving standards; increasing vocational relevance; contributing \nto knowledge -based economies; enriching learning experiences; transforming pedagogy to make \nit more student -centered, constructivist in nature , and with a focus on higher -order l earning; and \nfacilitating personalized learning (Fullan, 2013; Hammond, 2013; Somekh, 2007) . Digital tec h-\nnologies are also essential to satisfy curriculum requirements, for example the Australian Curricu-\nlum\u2019s ICT general capability (ACARA, 2014) , and to facilitate emerging trends, for example \nSTEM education and workforce preparation (AiGroup, 2016; Baranyai et al., 2016) .

Despite b e-\ning the subject of considerable attention and research, the evidence of reformation or transfo r-\nmation of education through the integration of digital technologies is limited and evidence of i m-\nproved educational outcomes through digital learning is variable (Tamim, Borokhovski, Pickup, \nBernard, & Saadi, 2015; Zheng et al., 2016) .

These extrinsic  influences can be categorized into three groups : access to resources, institu-\ntional factors , and subject curriculum and assessment ( refer  to Figure 1 ). Firstly, students and \nteachers need access to resources. Use of digital technologi es in schooling is dependent on suff i-\ncient access to appropriate hardware, software, and infrastructure, including technical support \n(Fu, 2013) . Given the protean nature of digital technologies, teachers also need time to learn and \nplan (Skues & Cunningham, 2013) . Institutional factors such as school culture and leadership \nplay a mediating role (Fu, 2013) . The value placed on different kinds of pedagogies by members \nof the school community, including teachers and school leaders, can positively or negatively i m-\nDigital Learning -  Conceptualizing Challenges & Influences  \n538 pact on how digital technologies are used. Similarly, institutional regard for or resistance to inn o-\nvation is influential (Ertmer et al., 2012) . Subject curriculum and assessment, particularly with \nhigh-stakes external assessm ent, represents a barrier to digital learning (Fu, 2013; Orlando, 2013) . \nWhile it has been argued that access to resources has been largely addressed in some educational \njurisdictions, such as United State s of America (Ertmer et al., 2012 ), the other extrinsic factors \nrema in influential.  \nThe introduction  of digital technologies in schooling  is often associated with an  agenda that \novertly or implicitly requires improvement, for example , the Australia n Government \u2019s Digital \nEducation Revolution (Austra lian National Audit Office, 2011 ). As such, digital technologies are \nVygotskia n mediating tools introduced to activate change with in activity system s as described by \nActivity Theory. \u2018Subjects\u2019 (teachers) use \u2018tools\u2019 (digital technologies) to facilitate an \u2018object\u2019 \n(pedagogy) towards an \u2018outcome\u2019 (student learning).

This suggests the need for a complementary theoretical lens more \nsuited to conceptualizing intrinsic influences.  \nIntrinsic  Influences  \nIn addition to extrinsic influences, te acher practice is also subject to intrinsic influences, also \ncalled second -order barriers (Ertmer , Ottenbreit -Leftwich, & York , 2007) . When integrating dig i-\ntal technologies, intrinsic influences on teacher practice  are dominant and more challenging \n(Blackwell, Lauricella, Wartella, Robb, & Schomburg, 2013; Hsu & Kuan, 2013; Vanderlinde & \nvan Braak, 2010) . According to Ertmer  et al.  (2012, p. 433) , intrinsic influences  are \u201cthe true \ngatekeepers\u201d. Intrinsic influences include factors that occur within the individual teacher and can \nbe categorized into four groups: attitudes and beliefs; innovation and routine; knowledge and \nskill; and vision and design thinking ( Refer  to Figure 1 ). \nTeachers\u2019  attitude s \u2013 like or dislike  \u2013 towards digital technologies is a strong predictor of their \nacceptance of and engagement  with digital learning; like is associated with acceptance and en-\ngagement , dislike is not  (Hsu & Kuan, 2013; Pegler, Kollewyn, & Crichton, 2010) . Use of tech-\nnology in schooling is  compounded by an individual\u2019s attitude to innovation as described by \nRogers\u2019 (2003)  diffusion of innovations  (Pegler  et al. , 2010) . Personal attitudes and beliefs are \nstrongly linked to profes sional beliefs and habits of mind, both of which control teacher practice \n(Cranton & King, 2003; Galvis, 2012) . Beliefs about digital technologies in teaching and learning \nare similarly influential (Hsu & Kuan, 2013; Pegler  et al. , 2010; Petko, 2012) .

The transformative \nrepresentation of digital technologies in teaching and learning, namely, facilitation of student -\ncentered, construct ivist pedagogies, can conflict with a teacher\u2019s pedagogical beliefs (Ertmer & \nOttenbreit- Leftwich, 2010) . Teachers wh o prefer  teacher -centric pedagogies find the student -\ncentric rationale for digital learning difficult to accept (Mama & Hennessy, 2013) . When attemp t-\ning to integrate digital technologies in practice, there is a gap between teachers\u2019 espoused and \nenacted beliefs (Prestridge, 2012) . \nRoutines also play an imp ortant role in teacher practice;  unfortunately, the integration of digital \ntechnologies disrupts routines (Somekh, 2007) . This factor was originally identified by Ertmer \n(1999)  yet, given its significance to teacher practice and centrality in epistemic identity (Claxton, \n2008; Cranton & King, 2003) , it has not been explored in the literature to the same extent as other \nintrinsic influences. This represents a limitation of current research because teachers use routines \nand associated intuitive practices to quickly read and respond in a wide ra nge of situations. A c-\ncording to Somekh (2007) , routines are important for teachers. When introduced in classrooms, \ndigital technologies can disrupt  existing routines (Ertmer, 1999)  and negat ively influence teacher \nconfidence (Prestridge, 2012) , reputation, and identity (Claxton, 2008) . \nThere is considerable focus in the literature on  the intrinsic influence of teacher knowledg e and \nskill as well as teacher vision and design thinking ( Refer  to Figure 1 ).

They are more implicit and harder to access  (Prestridge, \n2012; Somekh, 2007) . Hence, the disruption of routine and teacher attitudes and beliefs  are the \nfocus of this paper.  \nComplicating Factors  \nThe integration of digital technologies in schooling and actualization of digital learning is an on-\ngoing challenge that is complicated  by a range of factors. Firstly, there has been an improvement \nin the access to and adoption of technology, \u201cbut not in t he timeframe or ways expected by soci e-\nty\u201d (Howard & Mozejko, 2015, p. 166) . The expectations of society are compounded by the fact \nthat the process of change is complex and not uniform (Orlando, 2014) . As a result , the path to \nactualizing digital learning is unclear  due to variety in expectations and the challenges associated \nwith change . Secondly, the constr uctivist presupposition for digital learning has been questioned \nby some researchers (Orlando, 2013) . Teachers can employ a range of pe dagogies to facil itate \nlearning; not all are constructivist in nature. The constructivist  presupposition of digital learning \nmay clash with teachers\u2019 understanding of good practice thereby making its application proble m-\natic.

Finally, it seem s \nthe new pedagogies made possible via the integration of technology , constructivist or otherwise, \nare not well  or widely understood (Fullan, 2013) . The integration of digital technologies in \nschooling and actualization of digital learning is occurring in contested territory and the yar d-\nsticks for success are inconsistent.  \nUnlike the extrinsic influences of digital technologies in teacher practice, a framework does not \nexist to conceptualize the intrinsic influences. Indeed, the complex interaction between extrinsic \nand intrinsic influences is not well conceptualized. This paper offers a framework to address this \nneed.  \nMethodology  \nResearch  Design \nThis research was a case study conducted in an independent college in Queensland, Australia. All \nteachers and students had ubiquitous access to personal digital technologies (iPads) supported by \nextensi ve infrastructure (campus -wide WiF i and high -speed internet access) and cloud -based so-\nlutions (Apple\u2019s ecosystem and Google Apps). The school\u2019s model of technology provision star t-\ned in 2011 with two year -levels. By 2014, all students and teachers had access to personal tech-\nnology. There was an institutional expectation that digital technologies were integrated in teach-\ning and learning. Prior to the case study, the school\u2019s \u2018e -learning coach\u2019 conducted a school -wide \nanalysis based on teacher self -assessment using Puentedura\u2019s (2013)  Substitution Augmentation \nModific ation Redefinition (SAMR) model. Based on voluntary responses f rom sixty teachers \n(N=60), two -thirds (N=40) indicated that digital technologies were typically used to enhance \npractice via substitution into or augmentation of established pedagogies.

According to the Blundell, Lee, & Nykvist  \n 541 school\u2019s \u2018e -learning coach\u2019 , transforming pedagogical practice was, for most staff, challenging \ndue to a range of influences that were difficult for teachers to conceptualize and hence address. \nThis informed the research question: how can theoretical lenses be leveraged to conceptualize the \nchallenges of transforming practice to actualize digital learning?  \nSix teachers (N=6) volunteered to participate in a project to collaboratively design and implement transformative digital learning experiences. They were supported in  this endeavor  by the first a u-\nthor and two additional teachers: the school\u2019s \u2018e -learning coach\u2019 whose role is to support the ac-\ntualization of digital learning and another volunteer teacher who previously demonstrated tran s-\nformation of pedagogy in support of digital learning.

Four indicated they enhanced their practice by using digital technologies as a substitute for or \naugmentation of existing pedagogies. Two teachers reported they had actively explored opport u-\nnities to transform their pedagogy by using digital t echnologies to modify or redefine pedagogies.  \nAs part of their project  to design, develop and implement a transformative digital learning exper i-\nence, the teachers were guided to explore the influences on their practice.

Unlike the other teach-\ners, Taylor had very strong opinions about the contradictions presented by digital technologies in \nschool and life. D espite proclaiming a  strong personal interest in technology , Taylor  also strongly \nstated concerns about the place of digital technology in learning (see intrinsic influences section) . \nDuring the implementation of the new digital learning pedagogy developed by the team, Taylor recounted that, due to uncertainty and discomfort, it was difficult to enact the intended roles of \nthe teacher. A s a result, Taylor disengaged while the students worked. \nDuring a team -based reflection on the use of Activity Theory, the teachers recognized the value \nof this lens and its use as an analysis tool. Using Activity Theory facilitated open engagement in \nconversation about challenges associated with extrinsic influences. B y conceptualizing  those \nchallenges as contradictions in an activity system , the teachers noted that using Activity Theory \nprevented the process of identifying extrinsic influences from being viewed as personal crit i-\ncism s. Rather  these contradictions were positioned as elements of  a shared context . \nIntrinsic Influences  \nIn addition to identifying extrinsic influences on their practice, the teachers were also asked to \ndescribe intrinsic influences when utilizing digital technologies  (refer  to Table 2 ). The two most \ncommon categori es of intrinsic influences were the implications for professional routines, and \npersonal attitudes and beliefs about the place and role of digital technologies in teaching and \nlearning. Factors like improving teacher knowledge and skills were also identified.

It seems that using Activity Theory allowed the teachers to \nbetter understand the contradictions and , in the process of doing so, the re was a reduction in the \nperceived significance of those contradictions for all teachers except Taylor . The contradictions \nidentified by Taylor  \u2013 time complications and curriculum challenges \u2013 seemed linked with deeper \nintrinsic  concerns and  dilemma  associ ated with changes in roles.  \nResponses from the case study highlight the limitations of solely relying on Activity Theory to \ninvestigate the complexity of digital learning in schools. As illustrated in Figures 4c and 4e, pa r-\nticipants in the case study ident ified the perceptions of colleagues, students, and parents towards \nthe role of digital technologies in schooling as important influences in their practice. By its na-\nture, Activity Theory focuses on systems. While it acknowledges that these systems are the prod-\nuct of human activity, Activity Theory inadequately elucidates intrinsic factors. Routines, att i-\ntudes , and beliefs, which are particularly influential on the integration of digital technologies in \nteacher practice (Prestridge, 2012) , are not sufficiently elucidated. This appears to be reinforced \nby Taylor\u2019s unchanged assessment of extrinsic influences. This teacher\u2019s strong, intrinsically held \nattitudes and beliefs seemed to influence her/his  assessment of the influences in her/his  activity \nsystem.  For these reasons, relying solely on Activity Theory to conceptualize the challenges of \ndigital learning is limiting because intrinsic influences are not adequately addressed.

System 1 and System 2 Thinking \nTheory describes thinking as two metaphorical agents: one form is unconscious automated thin k-\ning (System 1), the other is conscious thinking (System 2) (Kahneman, 2011) . System 1 repr e-\nsents all apparently fast, unconscious or automated thought including impressions, feelings, intu i-\ntion, and creativity.

System 1 does not ti re easily. \nWhen certain patterns are recognized or when stimuli cannot be adequately processed, System 1 calls System 2 into action. System 2 has capacity for analytical and complex computation leading \nto considered decision- making; it also has capacity to  plan ahead. System 2 processes consume \nlarge amounts of energy, and when strongly activated, System 2 tires easily. For this reason, Sy s-\ntem 2 prioritizes activities, and when at capacity, other information and alerts from System 1 are Blundell, Lee, & Nykvist  \n 553 not processed. In es sence, automated processes in System 1 preserve the limited resources of Sy s-\ntem 2 for specific functions, when needed (Hattie & Yates, 2014; Kahneman, 2011) . \nFor teachers, System 1 and System 2 thinking processes play important, complementary roles. \nTeaching requires long hours of practice in dynamic social situations. System 1 allows teachers to  \nskillfully perform over extended periods by quickly reading and responding to stimuli (Hattie & Yates, 2014) , using routines and intuitions (Kahneman, 2011) . This capacity to unconsciously \nread a situation is called a blink response (Hattie & Yates, 2014) , and the associated rapid r e-\nsponse is described as an expert",

This capacity to unconsciously \nread a situation is called a blink response (Hattie & Yates, 2014) , and the associated rapid r e-\nsponse is described as an expert intuition (Duggan, 2007) . Insights, intuitions, feelings , and i m-\nplicit attitudes form in System 1, and if considered by System 2, can become explicit attitudes and \nthoughts. Hence System 1 and System 2 Thinking Theory is useful for conceptualizing the role of \nroutine, attitudes , and beliefs in teacher practice and their influence on digital technologies in \nteaching and learning. \nDisruption of routine \nThrough experience and expertise, teachers develop capacity to quickly read and respond to a  \nrange of situations (Berliner, 2004; Somekh, 2007) . Classroom and school pract ice results in the \ndevelopment of pattern recognition and associated behaviors that are triggered, often unco n-\nsciously, by stimuli (Hattie & Yates, 2014) . The integration of digital technologies in classroom \nlearning is acknowledged to disrupt established routines, leading to teachers feeling discomfort, \ndrained, and tired (Somekh, 2007) . The finding that teachers needed to relearn what \u2018on task\u2019 be-\nhaviour looked and sounded like is a strong case in point. The classroom cues generated by st u-\ndents using technology led to automated System -1-based responses that, on conscious inspection \nby the teachers, were wrong: the students were engaged, but this looked and sounded diffe rent to \nwhat was unconsciously expected. Similarly, the disruption of teachers\u2019 routines for monitoring student engagement and progress also led to discomfort and uncertainty. Responding to these \nchanges required teachers to consciously engage System 2 thi nking to develop strategies to r e-\nspond appropriately in the new classroom dynamic. In time and with practice, these new strat e-\ngies may have become more automated  by involving System 1 thinking. In the absence of aut o-\nmated strategies,  however, a sense of di scomfort was experienced by all teachers.  \nThe digital learning experience collaboratively developed by the teachers required a change in \ntheir roles in the classroom.

Questions like \u201cwhy am I here?\u201d  and emotional responses, such as \u201cI \nwas scared\u201d  and \u201cfeel ing a little insecure\u201d , highlight teacher dependence on routine. Despite be-\ning authors of this change, the associated discomfort and uncertainty was clearly evident, hig h-\nlighting the contribution of System 1 routines to teacher practice. Once developed and consisten t-\nly reliable, classroom routines build teacher confidence (Somekh, 2007) , ultimately leading to \nroutines and habits of mind that inform a teacher\u2019s epistemic identity (Claxton, 2008; Cranton & King, 2003) . This serves to conceptualize the significant discomfort associated with any change \nin teacher role.  \nAttitudes and beliefs  \nWhen digital technologies are introduced into schools, teachers evaluate the perceived value of \nthe technologies relative to their personal attitudes and beliefs about the nature of good teaching \n(Mama & Hennessy, 2013; Pegler  et al. , 2010) . System 1 and System 2 Thinking Theory provides \ninsight. System 1 processes cannot be articulated directly and must be communicated via System \n2. Implicit attitudes form in System 1, but must be transformed into explicit attitudes in System 2 \nin order to be expressed (Kahneman, 2011) . Similarly, System 1 can develop impressions and \nintuitions, but these must be expressed as beliefs by System 2 (Hattie & Yates, 2014) . This offers \nuseful conceptualization: implicit attitudes, impressions , and intuitions form in System 1 in r e-\nsponse to the complex stimuli it receives and filters. However, the communication of explicit att i-Digital Learning -  Conceptualizing Challenges & Influences  \n554 tudes and beliefs via System 2 suggests potential refor mation and loss of complexity. Similarly, \nnew ideas received via System 2 are compared to existing frames of refe rence \u2013 implicit attitudes \nand beliefs  \u2013 in System 1. Inconsistent ideas may be discarded, though the reasons may be u n-\nclear and hard for the individual to re -examine (Hattie & Yates, 2014; Kahn",

In e s-\nsence, an individual may experience discomfort triggered by System 1, but may find difficulty \narticulating, in detail, the exact cause.  \nThe teachers in the case study all expressed positive attitudes to digital technologies in schooling \nand pedagogy. Their articulations of pedagogical beliefs in the first interview were quite general \nthough typically positive, suggesting the teachers\u2019 impl icit attitudes and beliefs in System 1 were \nlargely consistent with conscious engagement with the topic of digital technologies in schooling \nusing System 2. As noted in the findings, following the implementation of the digital learning \nexperience, the teachers were more specific in their description of newly formed pedagogical b e-\nliefs, suggesting a more conscious elaboration of those beliefs. Some conflict between implicit attitudes and beliefs in System 1 and reforming explicit attitudes and beliefs in System 2 was ev i-\ndent in the discomfort associated with changed teacher and student roles. The failure of existing routines for determining \u2018on task\u2019 behaviour and management of student progress might  have \nbeen compounded by implicit attitudes and beliefs in S ystem 1 about the nature of student e n-\ngagement in learning. Conflict between System 1 and System 2 was most evident in Taylor\u2019s \ncase. While articulating positive attitudes and beliefs about the role of digital technology in \nschooling, this teacher struggle d to resolve her/his  changed role during the student -centric digital \nlearning activity.

System \n1 and System 2 Thi nking Theory allows for consideration of the intrinsic influences of routine, \nattitudes , and beliefs as the function of dual systems of unconscious and conscious thinking. \nTransformative Learning Theory ( Mezirow, 2009)  is offered as a tool to conceptualize the d y-\nnamics surrounding changes in teacher practice in the milieu of interacting extrinsic and intrinsic \ninfluences.  \nThe reformation or transformation of teacher practice via the integration of digit al technologies \nand actualization of digital learning pedagogies involves change and, hence , is associated with \nlearning and meaning making for teachers. Mezirow\u2019s (2009)  Transformative Learning Theory \nposits that adult learning is distinct from childhood learning because the development of meaning \nis influenced by prior experience and learning, perceptions, assumptions, and expectations. R e-\nsponses to new ideas are influenced by frames of reference, habits of mind, and points of view. \nFrames of references are deeply intrinsic structures used to understand the world that are based on \nexperiences, associations, concepts, values, feelings, and conditioned responses (Mezirow, 1996) . \nFrames of reference are consistent with System 1 thinking processes as they comprise predisposi-\ntions and difficult- to-articulate attitudes, beliefs , and mindsets (Cranton & King, 2003) . They also \nincorporate constructs that are \u201cinferred from repetitive affective experience outside of awar e-\nness\u201d (Mezirow, 2012, p. 82) . Frames of reference become the basis for habits of mind, which are \nbroad ways of thinking, feeling , and acting that orient behaviors (Mezirow, 1997) . Habits of mind \nare based on experience and are considered to inform teacher practice and identity. While they are difficult to articulate, habits of mind are influenced by a teacher\u2019s extrinsic institutional culture \nand intrinsic practices (Cranton & King, 2003) .

Points of view seem consistent with System 2 thinki ng in that they can be shaped or cha l-\nlenged by extrinsic influences. Transformative Learning Theory argues that an individual may \nexperience a disorienting dilemma when faced with new ideas that conflict with deeply held pe r-\nspectives and meaning schemes (Mezirow, 2009) . This is the intrinsic equivalent to the extrinsic \ncontradictions that occur in activity systems as the result of change (Engestr\u00f6m, 2009a) . \nWhen engaged in collaborative professional learning about digital technologies in practice, teac h-\ners are able to \u201ctry on\u201d other points of view (beliefs) and process these with System 2 t hinking. \nFor some teachers in the case study, the new points of view were sufficiently consistent with ex-\nisting frames of reference and habits of mind. Others felt some disorientation but collaboration \nseemed to allow engagement with and consideration of u nderlying elements leading to some form \nof resolution. This seems to  supports Kahneman\u2019s (2011)  proposition that points of view change \nwhen the perceived risk of an activity is reduced. However, in Taylor' s case the new points of \nview were inconsistent with underlying frames of reference and habits of mind, so there was a \nstrong tendency to reject them. This is particularly evident in the apparent conflict between Ta y-\nlor\u2019s positive statements about technolo gy in schooling and the resistance demonstrated to the \nchange in role during the digital learning experience.  \nTransformative Learning Theory has the capacity to describe the interacting influences of extri n-\nsic and intrinsic factors evident in teacher respo nses to changes associated with the actualization \nof digital learning pedagogies.

This is attributed to a range of interacting extr insic and intrinsic \ninfluences (Ertmer  et al. , 2012) .

At the point of confluenc e be-\ntween extrinsic and intrinsic influences on teacher practice, Transformative Learning Theory is \noffered to guide collaborative professional learning focused on transformation of practice.  \nThe findings of this case study demonstrate how the tri -theory framework was  used by teachers to \nconceptualiz e and re duce the perceived significance of extrinsic influences in their activity sy s-\ntem. Similarly, the framework  provided teachers with  a common language that allowed them to \ncollaboratively consider and  develop an appreciation of their  attitudes  and beliefs as well as co n-\ncerns about changes in their routines .

Digital Learning -  Conceptualizing Challenges & Influences  \n556 This case study provides insight to a team of six volunteer teachers seeking to transform their \npractice to realize digital learning through collaborative professional learning  in a school with a \nmature ubiquitous technology environment . Although this case  is specific to its context, this \nstudy\u2019s  generali zations are applicable to the emphasis that Activity Theory and Transformative \nLearning Theory place on using discourse about extrinsic and intrinsic challenges as the basis for \nprofessional learning . Change, however, is dependent on teachers transforming their frames of \nreference (attitudes and beliefs) as well as teachers reducing  their assessment of risks associated \nwith those transformations . There are at least two avenues for  further research : firstly,  the ap-\nplicability  of this  study\u2019s collaborative professional learning activity and its tri- theory framework \nin other contexts where teachers seek  to realize digital learning , for example, its applicability in \nschools at early stages of a ubiquitous technology deployment, or in situations w hen the use of \ndigital technologies is  mandated by curriculum documents ; secondly , whet her the tr i-theory \nframework can be utiliz ed in other situations  not related to digital technologies  in which teachers \nneed to transform their practice.  \nReferences  \nACARA .
